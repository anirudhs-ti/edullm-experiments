# LLM-Based Curriculum Matching - Complete Implementation

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive LLM-based comparison system that uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite model to assess how well direct instruction formats serve as scaffolding for curriculum substandards. This system replaces the TF-IDF approach with intelligent LLM-based assessment.

## Files Created

### 1. `llm_match_curriculum.py` - Main Script
- **Purpose**: Full LLM-based matching system
- **Features**:
  - Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite for intelligent assessment
  - Filters to 3rd grade curriculum only
  - Detailed logging for each substandard comparison
  - Progress saving after each substandard
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Same input/output format as TF-IDF version

### 2. `demo_llm_matching.py` - Demo Script
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates functionality with small subset
- **Features**:
  - Runs on 3 substandards vs 5 formats
  - Shows detailed comparison process
  - Perfect for testing and understanding the system

### 3. `test_llm_setup.py` - Setup Verification
- **Purpose**: Verifies data loading and API configuration
- **Features**:
  - Tests curriculum and formats data loading
  - Verifies Gemini API key setup
  - Shows sample data structure

### 4. `README_LLM_MATCHING.md` - Documentation
- **Purpose**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Features**:
  - Step-by-step setup guide
  - Usage instructions
  - Output format explanation
  - Logging examples
  - Error handling information

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ LLM-Based Assessment
- Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite (no vectors required)
- Intelligent scaffolding quality assessment
- Considers conceptual alignment, skill progression, cognitive load, instructional approach, and content relevance

### ✅ 3rd Grade Focus
- Filters curriculum data to grade 3 only
- Processes 112 grade 3 substandards
- Compares against all 116 instruction formats

### ✅ Excellent Logging
- Shows current substandard being processed
- Logs each format comparison with confidence and score
- Displays best match found for each substandard
- Progress updates and error handling
- Logs saved to `llm_matching.log`

### ✅ Progress Saving
- Saves results after each substandard completion
- Prevents data loss during long runs
- Allows resuming from interruptions

### ✅ Same Input/Output Format
- Uses same input files as TF-IDF version:
  - `curriculum.csv` (filtered to grade 3)
  - `all_formats_extracted.csv`
- Produces same output format:
  - `llm-extracted-instructions.csv`
  - Same column structure as TF-IDF version

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy google-generativeai scikit-learn

# Set API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Verify setup
python test_llm_setup.py
```

### 2. Run Demo (Recommended First)
```bash
python demo_llm_matching.py
```

### 3. Run Full Process
```bash
python llm_match_curriculum.py
```

## Expected Output

### Console Logging Example

```

## LLM Prompt Design

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that asks the LLM to assess:
1. **Conceptual alignment**: Same mathematical concepts?
2. **Skill progression**: Appropriate prerequisite skills?
3. **Cognitive load**: Appropriate challenge level?
4. **Instructional approach**: Does teaching method support learning?
5. **Content relevance**: Direct relationship to substandard?

## Error Handling

- Graceful API error handling
- Progress saving prevents data loss
- Detailed error logging
- Fallback responses for failed assessments
- Rate limiting protection

## Performance Considerations

- 1-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Progress saving after each substandard
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Comparison with TF-IDF Version

| Feature | TF-IDF Version | LLM Version |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Method** | Vector similarity | Intelligent assessment |
| **Speed** | Fast | Slower (API calls) |
| **Accuracy** | Keyword-based | Context-aware |
| **Explanation** | None | Detailed reasoning |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed algorithm | Adaptive assessment |
| **Cost** | Free | API costs |

The LLM version provides much more intelligent and context-aware matching compared to the TF-IDF approach, with detailed explanations for each match decision.
