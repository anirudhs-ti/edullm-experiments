# Implementation Summary: Curriculum to Sequence Mapping

## üéØ What Was Built

A two-phase LLM-based system to map curriculum substandards to Direct Instruction (DI) sequences, using Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent matching.

---

## üìä Data Overview

### Input Files
1. **Curriculum CSV** (`curricululm_with_assesment_boundary.csv`)
   - 622 total substandards
   - **112 Grade 3 substandards** (our POC target)
   - Contains: `substandard_id`, `grade`, `substandard_description`, `assessment_boundary`

2. **DI Formats JSON** (`di_formats_with_mappings.json`)
   - 15 skills (Counting, Addition, Multiplication, etc.)
   - Each skill has:
     - `grade_based_summary`: Text summary per grade
     - `progression`: Grade-specific sequences with problem types and examples
   - **11 skills have Grade 3 data**

### Example Dry Run

**Input Substandard:**
```
ID: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+1
Grade: 3
Description: "Write a multiplication equation that represents an equal sets of objects."
Assessment Boundary: "Factors limited to up to 5; No fractions/decimals; No real-world problems"
```

**Phase 1 Output (Skill Selection):**
```json
{
  "selected_skills": [
    {
      "skill_name": "Multiplication",
      "match_score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Directly addresses multiplication equations with equal groups"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Phase 2 Output (Sequence Rating for "Multiplication"):**
```json
{
  "skill_name": "Multiplication",
  "excellent_sequences": [1, 2],
  "all_ratings": [
    {
      "sequence_number": 1,
      "problem_type": "One digit times one digit",
      "match_quality": "EXCELLENT",
      "explanation": "Perfect match - addresses writing multiplication equations with factors ‚â§5"
    },
    {
      "sequence_number": 2,
      "problem_type": "Missing factor problems",
      "match_quality": "EXCELLENT",
      "explanation": "Uses ‚ñ° symbol for unknowns, matches assessment boundary requirements"
    },
    {
      "sequence_number": 3,
      "problem_type": "One-digit √ó two-digit",
      "match_quality": "POOR",
      "explanation": "Exceeds scope - involves multi-digit multiplication beyond equal sets"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Final Output:**
```json
{
  "substandard_id": "CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+1",
  "final_excellent_matches": [
    {"skill": "Multiplication", "grade": 3, "sequence_number": 1},
    {"skill": "Multiplication", "grade": 3, "sequence_number": 2}
  ]
}
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Two-Phase Architecture

#### **Phase 1: Skill Selection**
```
Input: Substandard description + assessment boundary
Process: LLM evaluates all 15 skills using their grade-specific summaries
Output: Top 1-2 matching skills with scores and reasoning
```

**Prompt Strategy:**
- Provides full substandard context (description + assessment boundary)
- Includes grade-specific summaries for all skills (~400 chars each)
- Asks LLM to score 0.0-1.0 and explain reasoning
- Validated with Pydantic schema

#### **Phase 2: Sequence Rating**
```
Input: Substandard + selected skill's sequences
Process: LLM rates each sequence as EXCELLENT/FAIR/POOR/NON-EXISTENT
Output: Only EXCELLENT sequences are kept
```

**Prompt Strategy:**
- Shows all sequences for that skill+grade
- Includes: sequence number, problem type, example questions, visual aids
- Asks for 4-tier rating with detailed explanations
- If no EXCELLENT matches, LLM provides explanation
- Validated with Pydantic schema

### Quality Tiers

| Tier | Definition | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| **EXCELLENT** | Perfect match - addresses substandard and respects all assessment constraints | ‚úÖ **Kept in output** |
| **FAIR** | Partial match - addresses some aspects | ‚ùå Discarded |
| **POOR** | Weak match - tangentially related | ‚ùå Discarded |
| **NON-EXISTENT** | No meaningful connection | ‚ùå Discarded |

### Resume Capability

The script saves progress every 5 substandards to `mapping_progress.json`:
```json
{
  "completed": ["CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+1", "CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+2", ...],
  "results": [...]
}
```

If interrupted, the script automatically:
1. Loads progress file
2. Skips already-completed substandards
3. Continues from where it left off

## üöÄ How to Run

### Step 1: Test Run (Recommended)
Test on a single substandard first to verify everything works:

```bash
cd /workspaces/github-com-anirudhs-ti-edullm-experiments
python3 test_mapping.py
```

**Expected output:**
- ‚úì API key found
- ‚úì Gemini initialized
- ‚úì Data loaded
- Phase 1 results (selected skills)
- Phase 2 results (sequence ratings)
- Final EXCELLENT matches
- "‚úÖ Pipeline is working correctly!"

### Step 2: Full Run (Grade 3 POC)
Process all 112 Grade 3 substandards:

```bash
cd /workspaces/github-com-anirudhs-ti-edullm-experiments
python3 map_curriculum_to_sequences.py
```

**What happens:**
- Loads curriculum (112 grade 3 substandards)
- Loads DI formats (15 skills, 11 with grade 3 data)
- Processes each substandard through 2 phases
- Saves progress every 5 substandards
- Saves final output to `/output/substandard_to_sequence_mappings.json`

**Progress tracking:**
```
[1/112] Processing CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+1
  Phase 1: Selected skills: Multiplication
  Phase 2: Rating 4 sequences for Multiplication
    Phase 2 Results: 2 EXCELLENT sequences found
  üìä FINAL SUMMARY: 2 EXCELLENT matches

[2/112] Processing CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+2
...
```

**Resume after interruption:**
Just run the script again - it automatically resumes:
```bash
python3 map_curriculum_to_sequences.py
# Loaded progress: 45 substandards completed
# Remaining: 67 substandards
```

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Runtime Estimates
- **Test run**: ~30-60 seconds (1 substandard)
- **Full run**: ~15-20 minutes (112 substandards)
  - Phase 1: ~1 API call per substandard = 112 calls
  - Phase 2: ~1-2 API calls per substandard = 150-200 calls
  - Total: ~250-300 API calls

### Cost Estimates
- Gemini 2.0 Flash pricing: ~$0.02-0.05 per call
- Total cost: **~$5-15** for full Grade 3 run

### Output Statistics (Expected)
```
üìä STATISTICS:
  Substandards with EXCELLENT matches: 85-95 (~80%)
  Substandards without EXCELLENT matches: 17-27 (~20%)
  Total EXCELLENT sequence matches: 150-250
  Average matches per substandard: 1.5-2.5
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Watch Progress in Real-Time
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run the script
python3 map_curriculum_to_sequences.py

# Terminal 2: Monitor logs
tail -f curriculum_sequence_mapping.log
```

### Check Intermediate Results
```bash
# View progress
cat output/mapping_progress.json | jq '.completed | length'

# View latest results
cat output/substandard_to_sequence_mappings.json | jq '.metadata'
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"**
```bash
# Check .env file exists
cat .env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY

# Verify it loads
python3 -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; import os; load_dotenv(); print(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))"
```

**Issue: "No skills found with grade 3 summaries"**
```bash
# Verify JSON structure
python3 -c "
import json
with open('data/di_formats_with_mappings.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
skills = [s for s, d in data['skills'].items() if 'grade_based_summary' in d and 'grade_3' in d['grade_based_summary']]
print(f'Skills with grade 3: {len(skills)}')
print(skills)
"
```

**Issue: Rate limiting**
- The script includes 0.5s delay between substandards
- If you hit limits, increase the delay in `main()`: `time.sleep(1.0)`

## üéì Next Steps After Completion

1. **Analyze Results**
   ```bash
   # Count substandards with matches
   cat output/substandard_to_sequence_mappings.json | jq '[.mappings[] | select(.final_excellent_matches | length > 0)] | length'
   
   # List substandards without matches
   cat output/substandard_to_sequence_mappings.json | jq '.mappings[] | select(.final_excellent_matches | length == 0) | .substandard_id'
   ```

2. **Review Edge Cases**
   - Substandards with 0 EXCELLENT matches
   - Substandards with >5 EXCELLENT matches
   - Check `no_excellent_explanation` for insights

3. **Validate Sample Matches**
   - Pick 5-10 random substandards
   - Manually verify the EXCELLENT sequences make sense
   - Check if assessment boundaries were properly respected

4. **Export to CSV** (if needed)
   ```python
   import json
   import pandas as pd
   
   with open('output/substandard_to_sequence_mappings.json') as f:
       data = json.load(f)
   
   # Flatten to CSV
   rows = []
   for mapping in data['mappings']:
       for match in mapping['final_excellent_matches']:
           rows.append({
               'substandard_id': mapping['substandard_id'],
               'grade': mapping['grade'],
               'skill': match['skill'],
               'sequence_number': match['sequence_number']
           })
   
   df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
   df.to_csv('output/mappings_flat.csv', index=False)
   ```

5. **Expand to Other Grades**
   - Modify `TARGET_GRADE` in script
   - Run for grades 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.
