YOUR TASK
---------
Evaluate whether THIS SINGLE SEQUENCE aligns with the intended curriculum design as specified in the Tasks and Step By Step Explanation sections.

Consider:

1. **Content Alignment**:
   - Does this sequence's problem type match what was intended in the Tasks section?
   - Are the example questions appropriate for the learning objective?
   - Are visual aids correctly specified?

2. **Pedagogical Alignment**:
   - Does this sequence fit into the intended instructional flow from Step By Step?
   - Is the difficulty level appropriate for where it would appear?
   - Does it build skills in the intended way?

3. **Boundary Compliance**:
   - Does this sequence respect ALL Assessment Boundary constraints?
   - Are there violations (wrong number ranges, prohibited operations, etc.)?

4. **Example Quality**:
   - Do the example questions match the problem type description?
   - Are they concrete, specific, and grade-appropriate?

DECISION CRITERIA
-----------------
**KEEP** the sequence if:
- It aligns well with the intended Tasks (score >= 0.7)
- It respects all Assessment Boundary constraints
- The example questions are appropriate
- It fits the pedagogical approach

**REJECT** the sequence if:
- It doesn't match the intended problem types (score < 0.7)
- It violates Assessment Boundary constraints
- The examples are inappropriate or off-topic
- It doesn't fit the intended teaching approach

PROVIDE
-------
1. **sequence_number**: {sequence_number}

2. **alignment_score**: A score between 0.0 and 1.0
   - 0.9-1.0: Excellent alignment
   - 0.7-0.9: Good alignment (keep)
   - 0.5-0.7: Partial alignment (borderline - usually reject)
   - 0.0-0.5: Poor alignment (reject)

3. **should_keep**: Boolean
   - true: Keep this sequence (score >= 0.7 and no violations)
   - false: Reject this sequence (score < 0.7 or has violations)

4. **reasoning**: Brief explanation (2-3 sentences):
   - Why you gave this score
   - What aligns or doesn't align with the intended curriculum
   - Any boundary violations

5. **suggestions**: If rejecting, how to fix it (2-3 sentences):
   - What needs to change in the problem type
   - How to better align with Tasks/Steps
   - What to avoid

Be specific and decisive. Focus on whether this sequence matches what the curriculum designers INTENDED.
