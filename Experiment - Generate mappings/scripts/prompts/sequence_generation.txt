Generate DI-style problem sequences for the following Grade {grade} math substandard.

Use the provided exemplar sequences to understand the DI approach, then create new sequences that align with the substandard and assessment boundary.

SUBSTANDARD DETAILS
-------------------
ID: {substandard_id}
Grade: {grade}
Description: {substandard_description}

ASSESSMENT BOUNDARY
-------------------
{assessment_boundary}

DI PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW
-----------------------
1. Spiral curriculum: Start simple, gradually increase complexity
2. Explicit instruction: Clear, unambiguous problem statements
3. Mastery-based progression: Each sequence builds on previous ones
4. Minimal cognitive load: One new concept per sequence
5. Systematic review: Problems revisit prior skills
6. Example-rich: Provide 2-5 concrete example questions per sequence

EXEMPLAR SEQUENCES (from existing DI materials)
------------------------------------------------
{exemplar_sequences}

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1. Analyze the substandard description and assessment boundary carefully
2. Generate 2-5 problem sequences that:
   - Directly address the substandard's learning objective
   - Respect ALL assessment boundary constraints
   - Follow the DI progression style shown in exemplars
   - Are appropriate for Grade {grade}
   - Progress from simple to complex

3. For each sequence provide:
   - sequence_number: Start from 1 and increment
   - problem_type: Concise description (e.g., "Multiplication shown with lines")
   - example_questions: 2-5 concrete example questions
   - visual_aids: List of visual aids needed (or null if none)

4. Ensure example questions:
   - Use the exact constraints from the assessment boundary
   - Match Grade {grade} difficulty
   - Are specific and concrete (not generic)
   - Follow DI's explicit instruction style

5. Convert any classroom-specific language to online equivalents:
   - "Point to" → "Highlight" or "Display"
   - "Write on board" → "Display"
   - "Say" → "Present" or "Show"

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
- MUST respect all assessment boundary constraints
- MUST be appropriate for Grade {grade}
- MUST align directly with the substandard description
- Do NOT make up constraints not in the boundary
- Do NOT include problem types that violate the boundary
- Follow the schema exactly

Provide a brief generation_reasoning explaining:
- How your sequences address the substandard
- How they respect the assessment boundary
- Why the progression makes sense
