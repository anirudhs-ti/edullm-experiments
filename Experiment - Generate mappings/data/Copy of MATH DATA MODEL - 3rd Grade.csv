## Finding Missing Numbers in Multiplication Equations

Sometimes a number is missing in a multiplication equation.

First, look at the groups and objects.

Next, ask yourself:
* Is the missing number how many groups there are?
* Or is it how many objects are in each group?

Then, count the groups or objects to find the missing number.

### How Arrays Show Multiplication

Arrays help us see multiplication in a visual way.  
When we look at an array, we can write a multiplication equation.

* One number tells us how many rows we have.
* The other number tells us how many objects are in each row.
* When we multiply these numbers, we get the total number of objects.

<<A colorful illustration showing a simple 3×4 array of red apples arranged in 3 horizontal rows with 4 apples in each row. The apples should be evenly spaced in a grid pattern on a white background. Each apple should be the same size and bright red color. Include dotted lines to clearly separate the rows and columns.>>

### How to Find the Missing Number in a Multiplication Equation

Sometimes, a multiplication equation has a missing number. We can use an array to help us find what is missing.

<<Array of 3 rows and 4 columns of blue circles with the equation: _ × 4 = 12 below>>
4 is the number of objects in each row.
12 is the total number of objects.
The number of rows is missing.
There are 3 rows, so 3 × 4 = 12.

<<Array of 3 rows and 4 columns of blue circles with the equation: 3 × _ = 12 below>>
3 is the number of rows.
12 is the total number of objects.
The number of objects in each row is missing.

### How Multiplication and Repeated Addition Connect

Multiplication is a faster way to add the same number many times.

Let's look at these pictures of apples. We see 5 groups of apples and there are 3 apples in each group.

Instead of writing 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, we can write 5 × 3.

<<A colorful illustration showing 5 groups of 3 apples each, arranged in neat rows. Below the groups, show the equation ""5 × 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15"" in large, clear text. Use bright red apples and green leaves, with each group clearly separated by light blue boxes.>>

### Changing Between Multiplication and Repeated Addition

To change a multiplication problem into repeated addition, look at the two numbers:

* The first number tells you how many times to add.

### From Repeated Addition to Skip Counting to Multiplication

We know that we can see multiplication as repeated addition, but when you add the same number again and again, you are also skip counting.

#### Equal Groups

<<Five groups of two dots, with red 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 labels above, all fitting in canvas>>

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10

5 × 2 = 10

Skip counting:
2, 4, 6, 8, __10__

#### Arrays

<<Five columns of two dots each, with 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 labels above>>

#### Number Line

<<Number line with 2+2+2+2+2 jumps>>

So all three connect:

Repeated addition → Skip counting → Multiplication

| Repeated Addition           | Skip Counting        | Multiplication   |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10     | 2, 4, 6, 8, __10__  | 5 × 2 = 10      |

**How to Multiply Using Skip Counting:**
* Pick the number to skip by (**group size**).
* Make that many jumps (**number of groups**), saying the numbers out loud.
* The number you land on is the answer.

**Example:** 4 × 6 → skip by 4s six times: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, __24__ → 24

Here are some more examples:

| Fact          | Skip Counting          | Answer |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------|
| 2 × 5         | 2, 4, 6, 8, __10__    | 10     |
| 3 × 4         | 3, 6, 9, __12__       | 12     |
| 4 × 2         | 4, __8__              | 8      |
| 5 × 3         | 5, 10, __15__         | 15     |
| 10 × 2        | 10, __20__            | 20     |

## LEARNING CONTENT

### Solving Real-World Multiplication Problems

Multiplication helps us solve problems quickly when there are equal groups.
Equal groups means each group has the same number.
In word problems, look for situations where you see groups with the same number of objects.
Ask yourself two questions:
- **How many groups are there?**
- **How many objects are in each group?**

Once you know these two numbers, multiply them to find the total.

**Quick Check:**
A teacher has 5 boxes of crayons. Each box has 10 crayons. How many crayons are there in total?

<<A diagram showing five boxes. Each box contains ten crayons.>>

**5 boxes**  
**10 crayons in each box**

**Click to see answer:**
There are 50 crayons in total.
**Explanation:** There are 5 groups (boxes), and each group has 10 crayons. So, 5 × 10 = 50 crayons in total.

# LEARNING CONTENT

## Grouping Objects to Solve Division

When we multiply, we put together equal groups to find a total. In division, we do the opposite. When we have a number of items, we can **divide** the items into equal groups.

Start with the total number of objects and make equal groups. Keep making groups until all objects are used, then count the complete groups.

<<A diagram showing 3 groups of 6 green apples, each group arranged in a circle, with arrows pointing from 'Total', 'Number of Groups', and 'Objects per Group' to an equation labeled '18 ÷ 3 = 6'.>>

For example, if you want to divide 18 items into 3 equal groups, you can make groups of 6 apples each: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.

## Arrays Show Division Too

An **array** is a set of objects which contains equal rows and columns.

With an array, you can:
* count the total objects
* count the objects in each row
* count the number of rows

<<A diagram showing a 3×4 array of blue circles (3 rows, 4 columns), with arrows pointing from 'Total', 'Number of Groups', and 'Objects per Group' to an equation labeled '12 ÷ 3 = 4'.>>

* Solve division equations using equal groups

## What Is a Division Sentence?

A division sentence is a way to show how we split things into equal groups using numbers and symbols.

There are two ways to use division:
(1) **Finding how many are in each group**  
OR  
(2) **Finding how many groups there are**

<<Poster comparing finding 'how many in each group?' versus 'how many groups?' with example illustrations.>>

## 1. How Many in Each Group?

Let’s look at a problem where we are looking for how many are in each group.

<<Guided image showing how to label the number of items in each group, with an equation shown as well.>>

When we split 14 cookies into 2 equal groups, each group gets **7 cookies**.

- Goal: Students interpret and write division equations that match visuals of equal groups and select true statements/equations that describe those models.
- Representations: Use images of equal groups of dots (or counters). Always identify total, number of groups, and dots in each group.
- Dual interpretations of division:
  - Unknown size: total ÷ groups = in each group
  - Unknown number of groups: total ÷ in each group = groups
- Strategy routine:
  1) Count total dots in the model.
  2) Count groups or count dots per group (as needed).
  3) Write one division equation with one unknown (□, ?, or __).
  4) Compute using skip counting or known multiplication facts.
  5) Check by multiplication: divisor × quotient = dividend.
- Constraints adhered to: dividends ≤ 100; single-digit divisors and quotients; no remainders; one unknown per equation; use □/ ?/ __ only (no letters); every item tied to an image of equal groups.
- Practice structure: I do (teacher models both interpretations), We do (guided fill-in and matching), You do (independent items across the three task types).
- Language supports: Sentence frames—“There are ___ dots in all,” “There are ___ equal groups,” “There are ___ dots in each group,” “So, ___ ÷ ___ = __.”

## 2. LEARNING CONTENT

### How Arrays Connect to Division

When you look at an array, you can write a division equation in two different ways. You can divide the total number of objects by the number of rows to find how many objects are in each row. You can also divide the total by the number of objects in each row to find how many rows there are.

<<A colorful illustration showing a simple 3x4 array of red apples arranged in 3 horizontal rows with 4 apples in each row. The apples should be evenly spaced in a rectangular grid pattern against a light blue background. Each apple should be drawn in a cartoon style with a green leaf on top.>>

**Quick Check:** Look at an array with 12 apples arranged in 3 rows. How many apples are in each row?

<summary><strong>Click to see answer</strong></summary>
4 apples in each row.
**Explanation:** When 12 apples are arranged in 3 equal rows, each row contains 4 apples.

### Finding Missing Numbers in Division Equations

Sometimes division equations have missing numbers that you need to find. Look at the array to count the total objects, count the rows, and count the objects in each row. Then use this information to fill in whichever number is missing from the equation.

## 3. WORKED EXAMPLES + GUIDED PRACTICE PROBLEMS

Use the examples on the left to help you solve the practice problems on the right. Then, check your work!

### Finding the Missing Part of a Division Equation

**Worked Example**

Look at this array. Complete the division equation: 15 ÷ 3 = ___

<<An array showing 15 purple circles arranged in 3 horizontal rows with 5 circles in each row. The circles should be evenly spaced in a grid pattern on a white background. Each circle should be the same size and bright purple color.>>

**Step 1:** Count the total number of objects in the array.
There are 15 objects total.

**Step 2:** Count how many rows the array has.
The array has 3 rows.

**Step 3:** Count how many objects are in each row.
Each row has 5 objects.

**Step 4:** Find which number is missing in the division equation.
The quotient is missing after the equals sign.

Use a concrete–pictorial–abstract sequence. Start with dot arrays (equal rows) and language frames to connect the visual to a division equation: total ÷ rows = in each row and total ÷ in each row = rows. Alternate between “how many in each row?” and “how many rows?” so students interpret division both ways. Always pair arrays with a one-step division equation using a single unknown shown by □/?/__ (no letters). Keep within assessment limits (dividends ≤ 100, single-digit divisors/quotients, no remainders). Have students verify by quick multiplication as a self-check.

We can write a multiplication sentence:

<<Rows × Number In Each Row = Total>>

This gives us:

**2 × 4 = 8**

Arrays help you see how multiplication works by showing equal groups.

## Division with Arrays

We can use the same array to make a division sentence:

<<Array with 2 rows of 4 soccer balls>>

- Rows: 2
- Number in each row: 4
- Total: 8

We have 8 soccer balls in 2 rows with 4 soccer balls in each row.

We can write a division sentence:

<<Total ÷ Rows = Number in each Row>>

This gives us:

**8 ÷ 2 = 4**

Arrays make it easy to see how division splits a total into equal groups.

","Instructional Approach
- Use arrays to connect multiplication and division. Always read arrays as “rows × columns.”
- Routine for every item (See–Say–Write–Check):
  1) See: Count rows and columns.
  2) Say: “rows × columns = total.”
  3) Write the four related facts with a single unknown symbol (□, ?, __) placed where the problem shows a blank: rows × columns = total; columns × rows = total; total ÷ rows = columns; total ÷ columns = rows.
  4) Check by multiplying or dividing and by re-counting the array.
- Scaffolding: begin with unknown product, then unknown factor, then division with unknown quotient/divisor, and finally unknown dividend.
- Constraints: only 1–10 rows/columns, totals ≤ 100, single-digit divisors/quotients, arrays only, unknown shown by □/?/__ (no variables).

## Prerequisite skills
- Count objects accurately to 100.
- Recognize equal groups and match objects to rows/columns.
- Read and use the symbols ×, ÷, and =.

- Identify and state “rows” and “columns” from an array.
- Record rows × columns in that order.
- Find the total by skip counting or multiplying within 10 × 10.
- Write the two multiplication and two related division equations for an array.
- Determine the missing number when the blank is the product, a factor, the dividend, the divisor, or the quotient.
- Use unknown-factor reasoning: if □ × c = total, then □ = total ÷ c.
- Check reasonableness by reversing the operation and by recounting the array.
- Use only □, ?, or __ for the unknown.

## Precise Vocabulary
- Array: Objects arranged in equal rows and columns.
- Row: A horizontal line of objects.
- Column: A vertical line of objects.

- Find the missing number in multiplication problems

## Parts of Multiplication

We know in multiplication, we have three parts:

1. The number of groups
2. Size of each group
3. Total

<<image naming the parts of a multiplication equation>>

We know how to multiply to find the total, but sometimes what is missing in a problem is the number of groups or the size of each group.

## Finding the Missing Size of Groups

**Example:**

4 groups of ___ = 8

This is the same as the equation:

4 × ___ = 8

We can use the multiplication facts we know or we can list them until we get the answer.

4 × 1 = 4  
4 × 2 = 8

<<4x2 = 8 shown with kittens in baskets>>

So we know the answer is 2.

## Finding the Missing Number of Groups

**Example:**

___ groups of 4 = 20

This is the same as the equation:

___ × 4 = 20

We can use the multiplication facts we know or we can list them until we get the answer.

1 × 4 = 4  
2 × 4 = 8  
3 × 4 = 12  
4 × 4 = 16  
5 × 4 = 20

<<5x4=20 shown with frogs on lily pads>>

So we know the answer is 5.

## Missing Number in Multiplication Sentences

We can also show this with multiplication sentences.

If you have your multiplication facts memorized, you can solve by using a fact that you know.  
If you don’t remember your facts, you can list them until you reach the answer.

### Finding the Missing Number in Multiplication Problems

When solving multiplication problems, sometimes a number is missing. We can use what we know about groups and totals to figure it out.

There are two main cases:

---

### Case 1: Number of Groups is Missing

**Example:** ___ groups of 3 equal 12

**What We Know:**
- Group Size: 3
- Total Amount: 12

We can use multiplication to find the missing number:

<<Colorful equation with a question mark times 3 equals 12: ? × 3 = 12>>

To find the number of groups, use a multiplication fact you know.
Or, you can list facts for multiplying by 3 until you reach 12.

1 × 3 = 3  
2 × 3 = 6  
3 × 3 = 9  
4 × 3 = 12

4 groups of 3 equal 12.

<<4 packs of crayons, each with 3 crayons inside.>>

It’s like having 4 packs of crayons. Each pack has 3 crayons. There are a total of 12 crayons.

---

### Case 2: Missing Number in Each Group

**Example:** 2 groups of ___ equal 14

**What We Know:**
- Number of Groups: 2
- Total Amount: 14

We can use multiplication to find the missing number:

<<Colorful equation with 2 times question mark equals 14: 2 × ? = 14>>

To find the number in each group, use a multiplication fact you know.
Or, you can list facts for multiplying by 2 until you reach 14.

1 × 2 = 2  
2 × 2 = 4  
3 × 2 = 6  
4 × 2 = 8  
5 × 2 = 10  
6 × 2 = 12  
7 × 2 = 14

2 groups of 7 equal 14.

<<2 soccer fields, each with 7 balls on the field.>>

It’s like having 2 soccer fields. Each field has 7 balls. Altogether, there are 14 balls.

- Anchor understanding in equal groups: show dots/counters in same-size groups, then match to “__ groups of __ equals __” and to a multiplication equation.
- Emphasize unknown factor as “How many groups?” or “How many in each group?” that makes the total.
- Use the routine: identify known factor and product, skip-count by the known factor to the product, count the jumps to find the missing factor, then check by multiplying.
- Representations: equal-groups drawings, arrays, and number line jumps. Keep numbers 1–10 for the unknown; no variables; use a blank/box.
- Progression: start with 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s; then 3s, 4s, 6s; then 7s, 8s, 9s. Use commutativity to choose the easier known factor when helpful.
- Consistent language in stems and explanations: “groups of,” “factor,” “product,” “missing number,” “makes the equation true.”
- Verification step: multiply the found factor by the known factor to confirm the product.

## Prerequisite skills

STEP 3: Write that number in the blank.","Instructional Approach
- Big idea: Division is an unknown-factor problem. Turn a ÷ b into b × __ = a and use known multiplication facts/skip-counting to find the missing number.
- Representations: equal groups and arrays (abstract, no contexts), number lines, fact triangles, and a 2–3–4–5–10 multiplication chart.
- Routine: I Do (model rewriting a ÷ b as b × __ = a) → We Do (skip-count by the divisor to reach the dividend) → You Do (students complete related facts and check by multiplying).
- Emphasis: fact families with the same three numbers; quick check by multiplication; precise identification of dividend/divisor; limited to divisors 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and quotients ≤ 10; no real-world contexts; unknown shown as __, □, or ?.
- Common errors to address: reversing dividend/divisor, stopping skip-count early/late, picking the commuted product (e.g., 4 × 6 when divisor is 6), confusing “number of groups” with “size of group.”

## Prerequisite skills
- Skip-count by 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 10s to at least 100.
- Recall/basic familiarity with multiplication facts for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10.

## Key Concepts

### Division Facts

When you memorize the multiplication facts, you can use the related facts to solve any division fact.

If you have not memorized the facts yet, you can use pictures of equal groups or skip-counting.

In a division problem, the **first number** tells us the total number of objects we are starting with.
The **second number** tells us how to split that total—either how many groups to make, or how many things go in each group.

Let’s look at a division sentence.

<<A visual representation of 20 hearts being divided into ten equal groups of two>>

An example would be if we had 20 hearts being divided into equal groups of two.

<<An illustration showing 20 hearts divided into 10 equal groups of 2 hearts each>>

We can see that 20 hearts divided into equal groups of 2 gives us 10 groups of hearts.

<<A division table showing 20 hearts divided into 10 groups of 2, demonstrating the concept of division by 2>>

Let's check our answer by looking at our two’s division table.

<<A two's division table showing that 20 divided by 2 equals 10>>

We see that 20 ÷ 2 = 10.

- Solve word problems involving division

## KEY CONCEPTS: Division Word Problems

Multiplication and division are connected. You can use multiplication facts to solve division problems.

For example, let’s look at this division problem:

20 ÷ 4 = ?

How are 20 and 4 related?

We know that 5 × 4 = 20, so 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Let’s look at an example:

Sofia brought **20 pencils** to school and shared them equally among her **4 friends**. How many pencils did each friend get?

The parts of the problem are:
- **Total:** 20 pencils
- **Groups:** 4 friends
- **Number of pencils in each group:** ?

<<A diagram illustrating the division of 20 pencils among 4 friends to determine the number of pencils each friend gets>>

To solve this, we can think about how many fours make 20, or 20 ÷ 4.

Let’s skip count by fours until we reach 20:
**4, 8, 12, 16, 20**.

It took counting by 4’s **five times** to reach 20 because 5 × 4 = 20.

This means 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

So, Sofia gave each friend 5 pencils.

## EXAMPLES AND GUIDED PRACTICE PROBLEMS

### Solving Division Word Problems

**Worked Example**

A teacher has 12 pencils. She wants to put them equally into 3 containers. How many pencils will be in each container?

**Step 1:** Find the total number of items.
The total is 12 pencils.

**Step 2:** Find the number that tells you about equal groups or shares.
There are 3 containers (groups).

**Step 3:** Divide the total by the number of groups.
12 ÷ 3 = 4

**Step 4:** Check that your answer makes sense with the question.
Each container will have 4 pencils. This makes sense because 3 × 4 = 12.

2. LEARNING CONTENT
Understanding Division in Real Life
Division helps us solve problems about equal groups. When you see words like ""equally,"" ""each,"" ""shared,"" or ""divided,"" those are clue words that division is being used.

What Division Tells Us
Division always involves three numbers:

Total: The whole amount you start with
Number of groups: How many equal groups you have
Items per group: How many items go in each group

<<A colorful illustration showing 12 apples arranged in 3 equal baskets with 4 apples in each basket. Labels point to: ""Total: 12 apples"", ""Number of groups: 3 baskets"", ""Items per group: 4 apples each"">>

The key insight: If you know any two of these numbers, division can help you find the third!

Reading Division Problems
Division problems give you two pieces of information and ask you to find the third:

Scenario 1: ""15 cookies shared equally among 3 plates. How many cookies on each plate?""

You know: Total (15) and number of groups (3)
You find: Items per group → 15 ÷ 3 = 5

Scenario 2: ""15 cookies put in groups of 5. How many groups can you make?""

You know: Total (15) and items per group (5)
You find: Number of groups → 15 ÷ 5 = 3

* Identify the five properties of multiplication: zero property, identity property, commutative property, associative property, and distributive property.

Zero Property of Multiplication

When you multiply any number by 0, the answer is always 0. This is called the **zero property of multiplication**.

**Quick Check:** What happens when you multiply 25 by 0?
**Click to see answer:**
The result is 0. Any number multiplied by 0 equals 0.

Identity Property of Multiplication

When you multiply any number by 1, the answer is always the same number. This is called the **identity property of multiplication**. The number stays the same.

<<A colorful illustration showing three examples of the identity property: 7 × 1 = 7, 1 × 15 = 15, and 42 × 1 = 42. Each equation is displayed in large, friendly numbers with the factor of 1 highlighted in bright blue and the unchanged product highlighted in green. The background is light yellow with small star decorations around each equation.>>

Commutative Property of Multiplication

When you change the order of numbers in a multiplication problem, the total stays the same. This is called the **commutative property of multiplication**.
3 × 5 = 5 × 3
2 × 8 = 8 × 2
7 × 4 = 4 × 7
This works for any multiplication.

**Quick Check:** If 4 × 6 = 24, what does 6 × 4 equal?
**Click to see answer:**
6 × 4 = 24. Switching the order of numbers does not change the total.

Associative Property of Multiplication

When you multiply three numbers, you can group them in different ways and still get the same total. For example, (2 × 3) × 4 and 2 × (3 × 4) both equal 24. This is called the **associative property of multiplication**.

<<Associative property illustrated with 2 × 3 × 4>>

Distributive Property of Multiplication

You can break apart one number into a sum and multiply each part separately. For example, 6 × (2 + 3) = (6 × 2) + (6 × 3). Then add the totals together. This is called the **distributive property of multiplication**.

Example:
1. Solve the equation 6 × (5 + 2).
2. **Step 1:** Distribute the 6 to both the 5 and the 2 inside the parentheses.
**Click to see answer:**
That means 6 × (5 + 2) = (6 × 5) + (6 × 2).
3. **Step 2:** Find the partial products.
**Click to see answer:**
6 × 5 = 30 and 6 × 2 = 12.
4. **Step 3:** Find the total by adding the answers together.
**Click to see answer:**
30 + 12 = 42

**Quick Check:** In the expression 5 × (3 + 2), which number is multiplied with both numbers?
**Click to see answer:**
The number 5 is multiplied with both numbers. It multiplies 3 and 2 separately.

Which expression shows the zero property of multiplication?
A) 8 × 1 = 8
B) 12 × 0 = 0
C) 3 × 4 = 4 × 3
D) 2 × (5 + 1) = (2 × 5) + (2 × 1)

**Step 1:** Read each multiplication statement.
There are four multiplication statements to check.

## Understanding the Commutative Property

Here is an important fact about multiplication:

You can multiply numbers in any order without changing the answer.

So:
8 × 2 = 2 × 8  
5 × 4 = 4 × 5  
7 × 5 = 5 × 7

In math, that’s called the **commutative property of multiplication.**

Let's say you have 3 packs of juice. Each pack has 4 juice boxes. You could also say there are 4 juice boxes in a pack and you have 3 packs. Either way, the total is the same:
**3 × 4** is the same as **4 × 3**.

<<Two arrays. The first has 3 rows with 4 juice boxes each (3 rows of 4). The second has 4 rows with 3 juice boxes each (4 rows of 3). Both have a total of 12 juice boxes.>>

When you see a multiplication problem, you can switch the order of the factors. The answer stays the same.

<<There is an image of an equation with a blank box where the missing number goes: 8 times 5 equals 5 times blank.>>  
Which number completes the equation to make it true?  

Answer:   
- The commutative property of multiplication says that you can change the order of the numbers you multiply, and the answer (product) stays the same.  
- In this equation, 8 × 5 is the same as 5 × 8, just with the numbers in a different order.  
- So, the missing number is 8 because 8 × 5 = 5 × 8, and both equal 40.

C. 6 × 1 = 6  
D. 4 × (3 + 2) = (4 × 3) + (4 × 2)  
Answer: A  
Answer Explanation:  
- The commutative property of multiplication means that changing the order of the numbers being multiplied does not change the product.  
- Option A shows the numbers 3 and 5 multiplied in both possible orders: 3 × 5 and 5 × 3.

D. Only expressions with the same order have equal products.  
Answer: B  
Answer Explanation:  
- Each pair of expressions has the same numbers, but the order is switched (for example, 7 × 6 and 6 × 7).  
- The commutative property of multiplication tells us that changing the order of the numbers does not change the product.  
- That means every pair in the table will have the same answer, even though the numbers are in a different order.  
- So, the correct statement is that the products are the same because multiplication is commutative.","Worked Example #1

What students see  
• Eight small “expression cards” in a tray (e.g., 3×7, 7×3, 4×6, 6×4, 5×8, 8×5, 9×2, 2×9).  
• Four horizontal “pair-mats.”  Each mat already shows the left card (3×7, 4×6, 5×8, 9×2); the right slot is empty.  

Task & drag action  
Drag one card from the tray onto each empty slot so every mat shows a commutative pair. Two extra cards stay unused as distractors.  

Why drag-and-drop is uniquely valuable  
The student must physically match and spatially group two items that belong together.  The open pairing space and extra distractors make the task many-to-many; the same assessment cannot be duplicated with a simple MCQ or fill-in-blank without exploding the number of answer choices.

Skill focus  
Identify equivalent multiplication expressions produced by the commutative property.



2. Flip-the-Array Builder (medium)  
What students see  
• Two empty rectangular boards side-by-side.  Board A is outlined 3 rows by 6 columns; Board B is outlined 6 rows by 3 columns.  
• A tray containing eighteen “single-row strips” (each strip is 1 × 6 dots) and eighteen “single-column strips” (each strip is 3 × 1 dots).  
• Prompt: “Show, with arrays, that 3×6 = 6×3.”  

Task & drag action  
Drag the correct strip type repeatedly to fill Board A (three 1×6 strips) and Board B (six 3×1 strips).  When every square is filled, both boards display 18 dots automatically.  

Why drag-and-drop is uniquely valuable  
Manipulating orientation makes the abstract ‘order switch’ concrete; the student must make two different physical constructions that still occupy the same area.  A text entry or MCQ cannot reproduce the spatial reasoning required here.

Skill focus  
Explain concretely why switching factor order keeps the product unchanged and solve the product by applying the property.



3. Balance-the-Equation Scale (medium)  
What students see  
• An interactive balance scale whose left pan is fixed with the expression 9×4.  
• Five movable “expression weights” in a tray: 4×9, 9+4, 2×18, 3×12, 9×3.  
(The graphics on each weight show only the expression, not the product.)  

Task & drag action  
Drag one weight onto the right pan so the scale stays level (i.e., choose the expression equal to 9×4).  If the wrong tile is dropped, the pan visually tips and the student tries again.  

Why drag-and-drop is uniquely valuable  
The immediate visual feedback of the scale embodies the idea of equivalence.  Because students manipulate physical “weights,” the assessment taps conceptual understanding rather than recognition of a correct line in a list of options.

• Two draggable “factor tiles” (5 and 36) sit directly under each bar.  

Task & drag action  
For every bar, drag the two tiles into the work-space slots in whichever order the student thinks makes the product easiest to find mentally.  A student who understands the commutative property will flip 36×5 into 5×36 (seeing 5×36 = 180 by using 5×30 + 5×6).  Some bars are already in the easiest order so they should be left unchanged, forcing a reasoning decision each time.  

Why drag-and-drop is uniquely valuable  
The student makes a self-directed, tactile reordering choice on multiple independent items.  Scoring looks at which bars were flipped and which were not, revealing strategic use of the commutative property—something far more cumbersome to probe with a single MCQ.

Skill focus  
Rearrange factors to simplify calculation and solve the resulting multiplication mentally.","1. “True Because It’s Commutative”  (medium)  
Prompt: Select ALL equations that are guaranteed to be true ONLY because of the commutative property of multiplication.  
a. 6 × 7 = 7 × 6  b. 4 × 9 = 4 + 9  c. 3 × 8 = 8 × 3  d. 5 × 5 = 25  e. 9 × 2 = 2 × 9  
Why multiselect is essential: Multiple correct equations are present and the number of correct choices is unknown to students, preventing guessing through elimination typical of MCQ.

4.  “Build the Best Explanation”  (hard)  
Prompt: Below are six statements about 6 × 9 and 9 × 6. Select ALL statements that together create a complete and correct explanation of why the two products are equal.  
1. Multiplication lets you switch the order of factors.  
2. 6 groups of 9 and 9 groups of 6 contain the same total items.  
3. The order does change the product when numbers are different.  
4. Addition would not allow you to switch addends.  
5. Because 6 × 9 = 54, 9 × 6 must equal 54 as well.  
6. Switching factors is called the commutative property.  
(Correct set: 1, 2, 5, 6.)

## LEARNING CONTENT

### Using Parentheses in Math Problems
Parentheses show us which operation to do first in a math problem. When you see numbers inside parentheses, always **solve that part first**.

For example, in the problem (3 × 2) × 5, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses first:
- First, multiply 3 × 2 = 6
- Then, multiply that answer by the other number: 6 × 5 = 30

If the parentheses are in a different place, like 3 × (2 × 5), you do 2 × 5 first:
- First, multiply 2 × 5 = 10
- Then, multiply that answer by the other number: 3 × 10 = 30

**Quick Check:** What should you do first in (4 × 2) × 6?
**Click to see answer:**
Multiply 4 × 2.

### Understanding the Associative Property
The **associative property of multiplication** lets you group numbers in different ways and still get the same answer.

For example, you may need to solve 2 × 3 × 4. You can group this in two different ways:
1. (2 × 3) × 4 → 6 × 4 = 24
2. 2 × (3 × 4) → 2 × 12 = 24

It does not matter which numbers are multiplied first. The product is still 24. This works for any grouping when you are only multiplying.

**Quick Check:** What are the answers to (5 × 2) × 3 and 5 × (2 × 3)?
**Click to see answer:**
Both equal 30.

Question: Which equation shows the **associative property** of multiplication?  
Options:  
A. 3 × (4 + 2) = (3 × 4) + (3 × 2)  
B. (2 × 5) × 6 = 2 × (5 × 6)  
C. 7 × 4 = 4 × 7  
D. (9 × 3) + 5 = 9 × (3 + 5) 
Answer: B  
Answer Explanation:  
- The associative property of multiplication means you can change how three factors are grouped using parentheses, and the product stays the same.  
- Option **A** shows the distributive property, which uses both multiplication and addition.  
- Option **B** has the numbers 2, 5, and 6 all multiplied, but the grouping changes: first (2 × 5) × 6, or 2 × (5 × 6). Both groupings multiply the same three numbers, and the answer will be the same.  
- Option **C** is the commutative property, showing you can switch the order of two factors.  
- Option **D** does not represent the associative property because the operations are not all multiplication. The associative property only works if the operations are ALL addition or ALL multiplication.

Question: Apply the associative property to rewrite the product:  
8 × (3 × 7) = ____  
Answer: (8 × 3) × 7  
Answer Explanation:  
- The associative property of multiplication tells us that when you multiply three numbers, you can group them in any way, and the product will be the same.  
- In the expression 8 × (3 × 7), the grouping shows that 3 and 7 are multiplied first.  
- Using the associative property, you can regroup to multiply 8 and 3 first, and then multiply the answer by 7.  
- So, 8 × (3 × 7) = (8 × 3) × 7.  
- The numbers stay in the same order, but the parenthesis show which two numbers you multiply first. The product will not change.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 24","MCQ, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Parenthesis-Placer (easy)  
What the student sees  
• The factors 8 × 5 × 2 are shown in a single line.  
• One movable “pair-of-parentheses” tile sits below the expression. When the student drags it between any two multiplication symbols, the tile automatically snaps so that the two factors to its left/right are enclosed.  
Task prompt  
“Drag the parentheses to show a different—but still equal—way to group the factors in 8 × 5 × 2.”  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must physically test possible placements until the expression reads 8 × (5 × 2). With three potential gaps to try, enumerating every location in a multiple-choice list is unwieldy and removes the spatial reasoning the property demands; the live movement of the bracket makes the regrouping concrete.


2. Double-Expression Builder (medium)  
What the student sees  
Left frame (locked): (6 × 4) × 3  
Right frame (empty): 6 × ( × )   (three open factor slots, parentheses fixed)  
Below: five loose factor tiles 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.  
Task prompt  
“Drag factors into the blanks so the right-hand expression uses the SAME three numbers as the left one and stays equal in value.”  
Correct action: the student drags 4 into the first blank and 3 into the second, making 6 × (4 × 3).  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The learner must choose and position two specific numbers from a set of five possibilities, not merely identify one answer. The combinatorial possibilities (order & placement) explode beyond practical MCQ listing, and the physical matching of sets concretely demonstrates equivalence through the associative property.


3. Associative Sort Board (medium)  
What the student sees  
Two headings: “First Two Factors Grouped” and “Last Two Factors Grouped.”  
Eight expression cards lie below:  
(9 × 2) × 5  5 × (9 × 2)  (4 × 3) × 7  7 × (4 × 3)  (6 × 1) × 8  8 × (6 × 1)  (5 × 2) × 9  9 × (5 × 2)  
Task prompt  
“Drag each expression into the column that tells how its factors are grouped.”  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must make eight independent placement decisions. A single MCQ or even multi-select cannot capture the many-to-many classification; the spatial act of sorting multiple items into bins directly reveals mastery of recognizing grouping without recomputing every product.


4. Word-Problem Grouping Planner (hard)  
Scenario text (locked):  
“A farmer packs 4 trays. Each tray holds 3 cartons. Each carton contains 6 eggs. How many eggs is that in all?”  
What the student sees  
Expression strip: 4 × 3 × 6 (no parentheses).  
Two draggable parenthesis pairs (one small, one large). Each pair snaps only around adjacent factors or around the product of the first two factors.  
Task prompt  
“Drag TWO sets of parentheses onto the expression to show a multiplication order that makes the total easiest for you to find.”  
Desired solution: 4 × (3 × 6) or (4 × 3) × 6 are both accepted.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
Students must create their own computation path by physically overlaying parentheses—mirroring how they would mentally “chunk” numbers before solving the word problem.

### Using the Distributive Property to Solve Multiplication Problems

The distributive property helps you break apart multiplication problems to make them easier to solve.

When multiplying 2 × 8, you can break 8 up into 3 + 5. The equation then becomes 2 × (3 + 5).

<<Visual model showing 2 × 8 as two rows of 8 orange dots, and 2 × (3 + 5) as two rows of 3 blue and 5 green dots.>>

Using the distributive property, you can multiply these parts separately by 2 and then add the results together. The equation then becomes (2 × 3) + (2 × 5).

<<Visual model showing 2 × (3 + 5) as a single box, and (2 × 3) and (2 × 5) as two separate boxes of blue and green dots.>>

The result is the same total, no matter which equation you choose.

Question Type: MCQ
Question: Which expression is equivalent to 5 × 4?
A. (5 + 2) × (5 + 2)
B. (5 × 2) + (5 × 2)
C. (5 + 2) + (5 + 2)
D. (5 × 2) × (5 × 2)
Answer: B
Answer Explanation:
5 × 4 means ""5 added 4 times.""
You can break the 4 into 2 + 2, so:
= 5 × 4 
= 5 × (2 + 2) 
= (5 × 2) + (5 × 2)","Worked Example #1
Question: What number replaces the ? to make the sentence true?
12 × 2 = (? × 2) + (2 × 2)
Step 1: Look for the common factor. Both small products on the right are “ ? × 2 ”, so 2 is the common factor.
Step 2:  To use the distributive property, we must split 12 into two addends, one of which is 2 (because of the 2 × 2 that’s already there).
12 = 10 + 2
So our two addends are 10 and 2.
Step 3: Write the big product using the split:
12 × 2 = (10 × 2) + (2× 2)
The number 10 ends up in our missing spot!

Answer: 10
*Remember:
Multiplication is commutative (the order of the factors doesn’t change the product). If you ever flip the two factors—like writing 2 × 10 instead of 10 × 2—you’ll still get the same answer.

","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Slice-the-Array (easy)  
   Task type addressed: Decompose numbers into addends to simplify multiplication.  
   Screen shows the full rectangular array for 6 × 9 (six rows of nine dots).  A single movable “cut line” sits on the side.  The student drags that line between any two columns to slice the array into two smaller arrays, instantly revealing the two addends (e.g., 6 × 4 and 6 × 5).  When the student releases the cut, the two partial-product labels appear so the student can see 6 × 4 + 6 × 5 = 54.  
   Why drag-and-drop is essential: Only by physically positioning the cut does the student prove understanding that the distributive property is about partitioning one factor.  No text entry or option list can capture the spatial reasoning of “where to split.”

2. Sum-Strip Builder (medium)  
   Task type addressed: Rewrite a multiplication expression by distributing a factor across a sum.  
   The problem 8 × ( + ) is shown above a parenthesis that already contains two empty “sockets.”  A palette holds length-coded number strips (1–10).  The student drags exactly two strips into the sockets so that the combined length equals a hidden target of 13 (the strip lengths remain visible, so the student sees, for example, 5 and 8).  When both sockets are filled, the screen automatically displays 8 × 5 + 8 × 8 and asks for confirmation.  
   Why drag-and-drop is essential: The act of picking and positioning two addends from many possibilities cannot be duplicated by MCQ without inadvertently giving away the pairings, and fill-in-the-blank cannot force the physical pairing of the addends that demonstrates understanding of factor distribution.

3. Dividend Chunk Conveyor (medium)  
   Task type addressed: Partition a dividend and use the distributive property to solve a division problem.  
   An 84-unit bar is shown on a horizontal conveyor.  A toolbox offers colored brackets labeled with multiples of 7 (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42).  Students drag as many brackets as they wish onto the bar to cover it end-to-end with non-overlapping chunks whose totals equal 84.  As each bracket snaps in, its “quotient contribution” (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively) appears above it.  When the bar is completely covered, the contributions automatically add, displaying the full quotient.  
   Why drag-and-drop is essential: Only live chunking forces students to prove they can break 84 into convenient 7-based parts and see that the quotient is the sum of the mini-quotients.  Listing numbers or picking an answer choice sidesteps the distributive reasoning.

4. Equivalence Card Sort (hard)  
   Task type addressed: Verify the equivalence of original and distributed expressions.  
   Two labeled bins are on screen: “Same Value as 9 × (4 + 6)” and “Different Value.”  A loose stack of expression cards is provided: 9 × 4 + 9 × 6, 36 + 54, 9 × 10, 9 × (7 + 3), 9 × 7 + 9 × 3, 90, 81, etc.  The student drags each card into the correct bin.  Cards lock in place; bins count how many remain un-sorted, nudging students to check their work.  
   Why drag-and-drop is essential: Sorting many movable expressions into categories forces an act-of-comparison process that can’t be matched by a single multiple-choice or blank.  The drag motion reveals cognitive grouping and makes students repeatedly test equivalence through the distributive lens.","1. Decompose-It Hunt (easy)  
Prompt: “Select EVERY expression that correctly uses the distributive property to find 7 × 8.”  
Answer set (multiple correct):  
• (7 × 5) + (7 × 3)  ✅  
• (4 × 8) + (3 × 8)  ✅  
• (7 × 4) + (7 × 4)  ✅  
Distractors:  (7 × 5) + 3,  (8 × 7) + 8,  7 × (5 + 2 + 1)  
Why multiselect is indispensable: Any single decomposition is NOT “the” right answer—students must recognize that several different break-aparts are valid at the same time. A single-choice item or a fill-in blank would force the author to privilege one decomposition and would fail to check breadth of understanding.

2. Picnic Table Problem (medium)  
Word situation: “A picnic planner sets 14 sandwiches on each of 3 tables. She breaks the 14 sandwiches into smaller groups to make counting easier. Choose ALL number sentences that correctly use the distributive property to find the total number of sandwiches.”  
Correct choices:  
• (3 × 10) + (3 × 4)  
• (3 × 7) + (3 × 7)  
• (3 × 12) + (3 × 2)  
Distractors mix wrong operations or mismatched totals.  
Why multiselect: The task measures whether students can transfer the property into a context, realize that more than one break-apart fits the story, and reject close-but-invalid statements. MCQ cannot capture simultaneous recognition of multiple valid strategies.

3. Break-Apart Division (medium)  
Prompt: “96 ÷ 8 can be solved by partitioning 96. Select ALL equations that correctly apply the distributive property for division.”  
Correct:  
• (80 ÷ 8) + (16 ÷ 8)  
• (64 ÷ 8) + (32 ÷ 8)  
Distractors: (72 ÷ 8)+(24 ÷ 6); (90 ÷ 9)+(6 ÷ 8); 96 ÷ (4 + 4).  
Why multiselect: Students must evaluate each candidate for BOTH numerical accuracy and structural use of the property. Only a multiselect format can reveal whether learners simultaneously accept every valid partition while rejecting the flawed ones.

4. True-or-False Gallery (hard)  
Prompt shows six candidate equalities. Students “check every equation that is ALWAYS true because of the distributive property.” Example options:  
• 5 × (6 + 3) = (5 × 6) + (5 × 3)  ✅  
• (9 × 4) + (9 × 1) = 9 × 5  ✅  
• 8 × (5 + 2) = (8 × 5) + 2  ❌  
• (6 × 3) + (4 × 3) = (6 + 4) × 3  ✅  
• 7 × (5 − 2) = (7 × 5) − 7  ✅ (still distributive)  
• 3 × (2 + 4) = 3 × 6 + 4  ❌  
Why multiselect: The set blends correct and subtly flawed equalities; mastery is demonstrated only if learners affirm ALL and ONLY the true ones. A single-choice or blank-entry item cannot probe this nuanced discrimination across multiple cases in one screen.

# LEARNING CONTENT

## Multiples of 10

Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and so on.  
Multiples of 10 always have a zero in the ones place.  
We can think about multiples of ten as **groups of ten**.

Let’s look at an example:

4 × 30 = ?  
30 is **3 groups of 10**.  
We can rewrite 4 × 30 = ? as  
4 × 3 **tens** = ?  
That is equal to **12 tens**.  
12 tens is the same as 120.  
So, 4 × 30 = 120.

**Quick Check:** What is 2 × 4 **tens** = ?  
**Click to see answer:** 2 × 4 tens = 8 tens, which is 80.

## Steps to Remember

To multiply by multiples of ten:
1. First, multiply the non-zero parts of the numbers.
2. Add back the zero at the end.

**example:**
2 × 80 = ?  
Non-zero parts:  
2 × 8 = 16  
Add back the zero:  
160  
Therefore, 2 × 80 = 160

Question: A delivery truck has 8 boxes. Each box holds 70 packages. How many packages are on the truck in all?  
Answer: 560  
Answer Explanation:  
To find out how many packages are on the truck, multiply the number of boxes by the number of packages in each box:

- There are 8 boxes and each box contains 70 packages.
- Think of 70 as 7 tens.
- Multiply 8 groups by 7 tens:  
  \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \), so you have 56 tens.
- 56 tens means 560 (because 50 tens is 500, and 6 tens is 60, total 560).
So, the truck has **560 packages** in all.

Question Type: MCQ  
Question: Which expression has a product greater than 400?  
Options:  
A: 6 × 60  
B: 5 × 70  
C: 9 × 50  
D: 4 × 80  
Answer: C  
Answer Explanation:  
To decide which expression gives a product greater than 400, first rewrite each multiplication as tens, then solve:

- 6 × 60 is 6 times 6 tens (6 × 6 = 36; 36 tens = 360)
- 5 × 70 is 5 times 7 tens (5 × 7 = 35; 35 tens = 350)
- 9 × 50 is 9 times 5 tens (9 × 5 = 45; 45 tens = 450)
- 4 × 80 is 4 times 8 tens (4 × 8 = 32; 32 tens = 320)

Only 45 tens makes 450, which is greater than 400. So, the expression is **9 × 50**.

Question: A mystery product is 630. One factor is a single-digit whole number. The other factor is a multiple of 10 (10, 20, 30, …, 90). What is the single-digit factor?  
Answer: 9  
Answer Explanation:  
- 630 can be thought of as 63 tens (because 630 ÷ 10 = 63).
- We are looking for two factors:  
  – a single-digit number  
  – a multiple of 10 (like 10, 20, 30, …, 90)
- Try different multiples of 10:  
  630 ÷ 10 = 63 (63 is not single-digit)  
  630 ÷ 20 = 31.5 (not whole)  
  630 ÷ 30 = 21 (not single-digit)  
  630 ÷ 70 = 9 (9 is a single-digit)

So, the two factors are 9 and 70.  
Therefore, the single-digit factor is **9**.

Select the two correct answers.  
Options:  
A: 6 × 3  
B: 3 × 10  
C: 6 × 3 × 10  
D: 6 groups of 3 tens  
E: 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30  
Answer: C, D  
Answer Explanation:  
- 30 is made of 3 tens (3 × 10).
- To find 6 × 30, you can multiply 6 × 3 × 10 (option C):
  - 6 × 3 = 18; 18 × 10 = 180.
- Or, you can think of it as “6 groups of 3 tens” (option D):
  - 3 tens is 30. Six groups of 3 tens is 6 × 30 = 180.
- Option A (6 × 3) does not include the tens place.
- Option B (3 × 10) does not include the 6.
- Option E shows repeated addition, which is another way to find the answer, but the question asks for methods using multiplication or place value, not addition.

So, the correct answers are **6 × 3 × 10** (C) and **6 groups of 3 tens** (D).","Worked Example #1

Answer: 300","MCQ, Fraction Model, Number Line, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Tens-Rod Place-Value Builder  (medium)  
Prompt: “Show the value of 7 × 40.”  
Screen shows a place-value mat with a Hundreds column and a Tens column. In a tray are draggable base-ten pieces: tens-rods (value 10) and hundred-flats (value 100). Learners drag pieces onto the correct columns until the mat exactly represents the product. As soon as ten rods stack in the Tens column, they auto-snap into one hundred flat, forcing students to reason about regrouping (place-value understanding). Scoring checks the final concrete model, not a typed number, so the task cannot be replaced by MCQ or a numeric entry.

2. Product Threshold Sort  (easy)  
Prompt: “Drag each expression into the correct basket.”  
Two baskets are labelled “Product < 250” and “Product ≥ 250.” Six draggable cards display expressions such as 3 × 90, 8 × 20, 6 × 50, 9 × 30, 4 × 40, 2 × 70 (no products shown). Students sort all cards. The simultaneous multi-card classification and the visual feedback of where each card lands make drag-and-drop uniquely efficient; a fill-in or MCQ would need six separate questions and lose the comparative reasoning element.

3. Delivery-Truck Loader (real-world)  (medium)  
Scenario text: “A truck must carry 5 stacks of 30 watermelons.”  
On screen is an empty truck bed outlined with three place-value bays: Hundreds, Tens, Ones. A tray holds watermelon crates, each labeled “10 melons.” Students drag crates into the truck until it shows the correct total load. Crates auto-group into flats of 100 after ten crates are stacked, echoing place-value regrouping. Success is judged by the concrete arrangement, not by a typed total, so the interaction can’t be duplicated by simple input.

4. Missing-Factor Balance Scale  (hard)  
Graphic shows a balance scale. Left pan: a blank factor box “□ × 50.” Right pan: three draggable weight tiles already fixed—one tile marked “150” and one tile marked “3 × 50.” A tray beneath the scale holds digit tiles 0-9. Students drag the correct single-digit tile into the blank so that the scale balances. Because the blank accepts any digit tile and the balance animates (tip/level) as tiles are tried, students engage in iterative reasoning that an MCQ cannot replicate; the concrete manipulation of digits against the visual balance embodies the property of equality and multiplicative reasoning demanded by the sub-standard.","1. “Same‐Value Hunt” (easy)

Cards shown: 8 × 30  6 × 40  4 × 60  3 × 70  5 × 50  2 × 120 (not a valid option)  
Why multiselect is essential: More than one card is correct (8 × 30, 6 × 40, 4 × 60). A single-answer MCQ can’t ask for “all that apply,” and a text-entry box would reveal how many answers are expected. Students must demonstrate place-value reasoning for several products at once.

Select ALL single-digit numbers that can replace ⬚ to make the statement true.  
Options: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
(Correct: 6, 7, 8.)  
Why multiselect is essential: Multiple factors satisfy the inequality. Students must test each possibility using 7 tens = 70 and reason about the resulting products. A one-box text entry or MCQ would capture only one answer.

3. “Box of Baseballs” (easy)  
Context: One box holds 10 baseballs. Coach Green buys several boxes.  
Select every statement that is TRUE.

• 9 boxes hold 90 baseballs.  
• 6 boxes hold 80 baseballs.  
• 8 boxes hold 80 baseballs.  
(Correct: first and last two bullet-points.)  
Why multiselect is essential: Students evaluate multiple real-world claims at once, showing repeated‐group understanding of 10s. Turning this into five separate MCQs inflates testing time; a single multiselect captures mastery efficiently and keeps the situational context intact.

* Solve two-step word problems involving multiplication

## What Are Two-Step Multiplication Problems

A **two-step multiplication problem** is a word problem where you need to multiply twice to get your final answer. The **first multiplication** gives you a number that you use in the **second multiplication**.

Let's look at this **example**:

Tom has 2 packs of stickers. Each pack has 5 sheets. Each sheet has 6 stickers. How many stickers does Tom have in total?

**Quick Check:** Choose the problems that would need two multiplication steps:
a) Sarah has 3 boxes with 4 apples in each box. How many apples does she have?
b) Mia has 4 trays. Each tray has 3 rows. Each row has 7 cookies. How many cookies does Mia have in total?
**Click to see answer:**
Problem b) needs two steps.
First, multiply trays × rows.
Then multiply that answer × cookies per row.
Problem a) only needs one multiplication step.

## Finding the First Multiplication Step

In two-step problems, look for the **first equal groups**, like ""2 packs of 5 sheets,"" to decide what to multiply first. Words like ""**each**,"" ""**per**,"" and ""**groups of**"" help you find what to multiply first.

For Tom's stickers, we can write the problem as:

(2 × 5) × 6

First, multiply the number of packs by the number of sheets in each pack:

2 × 5 = 10

This gives us the number of sheets. We will use this answer in the next step.

<<A colorful illustration showing a student with a magnifying glass examining a word problem on paper. The student is circling key multiplication words like ""each"" and ""per"" in bright red. The paper shows a simple two-step problem with arrows pointing to the numbers that need to be multiplied first. The background is light blue with mathematical symbols floating around.>>

## Using Your First Answer in the Second Step

Now, use the answer from the first multiplication. We found that 2 × 5 = 10, so we can rewrite the problem as:

10 × 6

Next, multiply 10 by 6 to find the total number of stickers:

10 × 6 = 60

So, 2 × 5 × 6 = 60. Tom has 60 stickers in total.

**Quick Check:** If the first step gives you 12 rows and the problem says ""each row has 7 cookies,"" what should you multiply next?
**Click to see answer:**
12 × 7. You use your first answer (12) and multiply it by the number of items in each group (7).

## Understanding Two Division Steps
A **two-step division problem** requires you to divide twice to find your answer. The first division creates groups or containers. The second division takes what is in each group and divides it again. You must complete the first division before you can do the second division.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine you have 24 muffins.

First, you put them into 4 boxes.

Then, you share each box between 2 friends.

Let’s break it down. We start with the total: 24 muffins.

<<Visual without description>>

The first action from the problem was putting the muffins into 4 boxes.

<<Visual without description>>

24 ÷ 4 = 6 muffins in each box.

The second action in the problem is sharing each box between two friends

<<Visual without description>>

6 ÷ 2 = 3 muffins for each friend.

So each friend gets 3 muffins.

**Quick Check:** Sofia has 18 apples. She puts them into 3 baskets. Then, each basket is shared equally between 2 friends. What are the two division actions in this problem?

**Click to see answer:**
6 apples in each basket (18 ÷ 3 = 6).
Then each friend will get 3 apples (6 ÷ 2 = 3)

## Multiplication and Division Word Problems

When you read a math story problem, you have to decide what the story is asking.

Sometimes the story is about equal groups, and that means you might use multiplication or division. But how do you know which one to pick?

## Multiplication

<<An illustration showing 4 baskets each containing 6 apples to demonstrate the concept of multiplication>>

**Example:** There are 4 baskets. Each basket has 6 apples. How many apples are there in all?

Because we know the number of groups (4 baskets) and how many are in each group (6 apples), we **multiply** to find the total.

4 × 6 = 24

So there are 24 apples.

## Division

<<An illustration showing 32 books divided evenly among 4 shelves, demonstrating division in a real-world context>>

**Example:**
A library has 32 books to place evenly on 4 shelves. How many books will go on each shelf?

Because we know there are a total of 32 objects (books) and they are being split between 4 groups (shelves), we **divide**. We are looking for the number of objects (books) in each group (shelf).

32 ÷ 4 = 8

So there are 8 books on each shelf.

## How to Decide: Multiply vs. Divide

**Remember:** Read the problem carefully first, then use these rules to know if you should multiply or divide.

• Price per pencil = $7  
• Money she has = $56  
• Number of pencils = n  

STEP 2: Write an equation that represents the situation.  
7 × n = 56  

STEP 3: Perform the necessary operation to solve for the unknown.  
56 ÷ 7 = 8, so n = 8  

Answer: Emma can get 8 pencils.","MCQ, Drag and Drop, Text Entry, Multiselect","1. Pack-the-Snacks (easy)  
Purpose: Solve a multiplication word problem by forming equal groups.  
Scenario: “The coach needs 5 snack bags, and each bag must hold 6 energy bars. Drag bars into the bags to show how many bars are needed in all.”  
Drag action: 30 bar icons sit in a “pantry.” Learner drags bars into the 5 outlined bag drop-zones; platform autogrades “6 bars in every bag, none left over.”  
Why D&D is irreplaceable: The student demonstrates understanding through the physical creation of equal groups; merely selecting or typing “30” would not reveal whether the groups were built correctly or whether the student understood the grouping structure.

2. Share-the-Stickers (medium)  
Purpose: Solve a division word problem by fair-sharing.  
Scenario: “Maria has 20 stickers to share equally among her 5 friends. Drag stickers into the 5 gift bags so each friend gets the same amount and no stickers are left outside the bags.”  
Drag action: 20 sticker icons ➜ 5 bag drop-zones. Correct solution: 4 stickers per bag.  
Why D&D is irreplaceable: The act of distributing objects exposes misconceptions (e.g., leaving remainders, unequal groups) that a typed quotient or chosen option cannot capture.

3. Build-the-Equation: Movie Tickets (medium)  
Purpose: Represent a multiplication situation with an equation containing a symbol for the unknown.  
Scenario: “A theater sold 9 rows of seats, with 8 tickets in each row. Drag tiles to make one equation that matches the story.”  
Tiles supplied: 8, 9, 72, ×, =, and a “?” tile. Drop-bar has five slots: ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ . Acceptable answers include 9 × 8 = ?   or   ? = 9 × 8.  
Why D&D is irreplaceable: Students must identify which piece should be the unknown and place the tiles in a meaningful order. Typing could mask this choice, and a single-answer MCQ would not expose whether the student confuses factors with product or mis-places the unknown.

4. Build-the-Equation: Cupcake Boxes (hard)  
Purpose: Represent a division situation with an equation containing a symbol for the unknown.  
Scenario: “A baker packed 36 cupcakes equally into 4 boxes. Drag tiles to write an equation that fits the problem.”  
Tiles supplied: 36, 4, 9, ÷, × (for alternate representation), =, and “?” tile.  
Valid constructions: 36 ÷ 4 = ?      or     ? × 4 = 36.  
Why D&D is irreplaceable: Learners must decide between two structurally different but equivalent equations and place the unknown correctly, revealing depth of understanding that a fill-in-blank or MCQ cannot show.","1. Orchard Harvest Equations  – medium  
Task focus: Write an equation (multiplication AND division) that represents one word problem.  
Prompt outline: “Luis picked 27 apples. He filled 3 identical baskets. How many apples are in each basket?”  
Choices shown (students may choose more than one):  
○ 3 × □ = 27  ○ □ × 3 = 27  ○ 27 ÷ 3 = □  ○ 27 ÷ □ = 3  ○ 27 – 3 = □  
Why multiselect is essential: More than one equation is mathematically correct (first three). Students must recognize every valid representation and reject near-misses. A single-response item or text-entry cannot reveal whether they understand that both multiplication and division equations model the same situation.

2. Match-the-Story Sort – easy  
Task focus: Decide whether a given multiplication word problem can be solved with a target fact (7 × 4) and its related division facts.  
Prompt outline: “Select ALL of the stories below that can be solved by 7 × 4 or 28 ÷ 4 or 28 ÷ 7.” Four short contexts are listed (two correct, two distractors).  
Why multiselect is essential: Students must select every context that fits, demonstrating flexible recognition of when a fact applies. One-answer multiple choice forces the item to hide some correct situations or split them across items.

3. Array Truth Statements – medium  
Task focus: Solve an array problem AND identify all true equations with a symbol for the unknown.  
Prompt outline: picture of 5 rows of 6 muffins. 30 is hidden. Part A (embedded): “How many muffins?” Choices are NOT provided.  
Part B multiselect: “Select ALL of the equations that are true for the array.”  
Choices: □ = 5 × 6  6 = □ ÷ 5  □ × 5 = 30  30 ÷ 6 = □  5 + 6 = □  
Why multiselect is essential: Students must judge truth of EACH statement, displaying understanding of both multiplication and division relationships within 100. A fill-in blank cannot check recognition of every correct/incorrect equation in one step.

4. Ribbon-Cut Challenge – hard  
Task focus: Solve a division word problem within 100 and choose every supporting equation.  
Prompt outline: “A 48-inch ribbon is cut into equal pieces that are 8 inches long. How many pieces are made?”  
Multiselect list mixes numeric answers and equations:  
○ □ = 48 ÷ 8  ○ 8 × □ = 48  ○ 48 ÷ □ = 8  ○ 48 – 8 = □  ○ □ × 8 = 54  
Students must (a) find 6 pieces, and (b) pick all equations that correctly model or solve for the unknown.  
Why multiselect is essential: The item verifies two competencies simultaneously—finding the quotient and linking it to every valid equation—something a single-answer format cannot do without breaking the standard’s integrated intent.",#REF!

- Solve two-step word problems that use multiplication and division

## Solving Two-Step Multiplication and Division Word Problems

Sometimes a word problem needs two steps. You will use multiplication (×) and division (÷).

## How to Decide the Order

**Multiply, then Divide (Make then Share)**

Use this when you know **how many groups** and how **many in each group**. Then you **share** that total equally.

**Example:**
There are 4 trays with 6 muffins each. Share the muffins equally with 3 classes. How many muffins does each class get?
- First: 4 × 6 = 24 muffins (make total)
- Then: 24 ÷ 3 = 8 muffins per class (share)

**Divide, then Multiply (Share then Make)**

Use this when you know a **big total** and how to split it into **equal groups** (or how many are in each group). Then **each item** in a group makes/gets the **same number**.

**Example:**
There are 28 seeds that are going into 4 planters. Each seed grows 2 sprouts. How many sprouts will each planter have?
- First: 28 ÷ 4 = 7 seeds per planter (share)
- Then: 7 × 2 = 14 sprouts per planter (make)

**Example**
Maria buys 5 packs of stickers with 8 stickers in each pack. She wants to divide all the stickers equally among 4 friends. How many stickers will each friend get?

**Step 1:** Find the first step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since we have 5 packs of 8 stickers, we do 5 × 8 = 40.
That gives us 40 stickers total.

**Step 2:** Find the second step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since she is dividing those 40 stickers among 4 of her friends, we do 40 ÷ 4 = 10.
So each friend gets 10 stickers.

**Practice**
Tom has 3 boxes with 9 toys in each box. He wants to put all the toys equally into 3 toy bins. How many toys will be in each bin?

**Step 1:** Find the first step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since Tom has 3 boxes with 9 toys in each, we do 3 × 9 = 27.
That gives us 27 toys total.

**Step 2:** Find the second step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since Tom is dividing 27 toys into 3 bins, we do 27 ÷ 3 = 9.

### Division Then Multiplication Problems

**Example**
A factory packs 48 toy cars into 6 boxes, with equal number of cars in each box. Then the boxes are loaded onto trucks, with 2 boxes on each truck. How many toy cars are shipped on one truck?

**Step 1:** Find the first step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since the factory first packed 48 cars into 6 boxes, we do 48 ÷ 6 = 8.
That gives us 8 toy cars in each box.

**Step 2:** Find the second step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since the trucks were loaded with two boxes on each truck and each box had 8 cars, we do 8 × 2 = 16.
So 16 toy cars were shipped on each truck.

**Practice**
The library has 24 books to put away. The books are divided equally onto 4 shelves. Each shelf is put onto a cart, and each cart holds 2 shelves. How many books are on each cart?

**Step 1:** Find the first step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since the library divides 24 books onto 4 shelves, we do 24 ÷ 4 = 6.
That gives us 6 books on each shelf.

**Step 2:** Find the second step.
**Click to see answer:**
Since each cart holds 2 shelves and each shelf has 6 books, we do 6 × 2 = 12.
So each cart has 12 books.",Kelly,Ready,Comments Actioned,,"Task: Solve a word problem that involves multiplication and then division.

## LEARNING CONTENT

### Writing Equations from Word Problems
You can use a letter to show an unknown number in a math problem. This letter is called a **variable**. You can write an equation to show the problem.

Here are some examples of equations that can be used to solve word problems. In these problems, the answer is unknown, so we use a variable to represent it.

| Problem | Equation |
|---|---|
| There are 8 red apples.
There are 5 green apples.
The letter a stands for the total number of apples. | 8 + 5 = a |
| There are 15 marbles.
4 marbles get lost.
The letter m stands for the number of marbles left. | 15 - 4 = m |
| There are 4 boxes.
Each box has 6 balls.
The letter b stands for the total number of balls. | 4 × 6 = b |
| There are 18 pencils.
They are put into 6 boxes.
The letter p stands for the number of pencils in each box. | 18 ÷ 6 = p |

Sometimes the missing number isn’t the final answer. One of the other numbers is missing, so we put the variable where that number goes.

Here are some examples:

| Problem | Equation |
|---|---|
| There are some cats in a yard.
4 more join.
Now there are 11 cats.
Letter c is starting cats. | c + 4 = 11 |
| There were 18 apples.
Some are eaten.
13 apples are left.
Letter a is the number of apples eaten. | 18 - a = 13 |
| There are some bags.
9 marbles in each.
There are 54 marbles.
Letter b is the number of bags. | b × 9 = 54 |
| There were 24 pencils shared by some kids.
Each kid gets 6 pencils.
Letter k is the number of kids. | 24 ÷ k = 6 |

The lesson sequence uses the “Concrete–Pictorial–Abstract” (CPA) model, gradual release (I Do / We Do / You Do), and daily formative checks.  Students first act out or model the problem with counters or base-ten blocks, sketch a quick picture or bar model, and finally write an equation that uses a symbol (□, ?, ___) for the single unknown.  Mini-lessons alternate between the four operations so that students learn to decide which operation fits a given context rather than memorizing keywords.  Each mini-lesson ends with an “Equation Gallery Walk” in which students compare how classmates placed the symbol in different positions (e.g., □ + 37 = 64 vs. 37 + □ = 64).  The teacher continuously prompts mental-math checks (“Does your answer make sense?”) to build estimation and reasonableness.

## Prerequisite skills  
• Fluent addition and subtraction within 100 (with and without regrouping)  
• Recall of multiplication and division facts within the 10 × 10 table  
• Understanding of equal groups, arrays, and the meaning of “each,” “in all,” “left,” “share equally”  
• Ability to read and comprehend one-sentence word problems  
• Familiarity with the equal sign as a balance showing equivalence  

## Microskills  
• Locate and underline the numbers in a word problem.  
• Identify the quantity that is unknown.  
• Classify the situation as join, separate, equal groups, or share equally.  
• Select the matching operation (＋, −, ×, ÷).  
• Choose a single symbol (□, ?, ___) to stand for the unknown.  
• Place the symbol in the correct position within an equation.  
• Write the complete equation using correct symbols and numbers.  
• Mentally estimate to see if the answer is reasonable.

## Understanding Two-Step Word Problems

A two-step word problem requires exactly two operations to solve. These problems start with a beginning amount. Two things happen to change that amount. Then you find the final result.

**Quick Check:** Look at this problem:
""Maya had 15 stickers. She gave away 3 stickers and then bought 8 more stickers. How many stickers does Maya have now?""
What two operations do you need to use?

**Click to see answer:**
Subtraction (gave away 3) and addition (bought 8 more)

## Writing Equations for Two-Step Problems

Sometimes a math problem takes more than one step. Instead of solving it right away, we can write an equation to show the steps. We still use a letter or symbol for the number we don’t know yet.

**Example:**
Lila has 5 apples.
She buys 4 more.
Then she gives 3 to her friend.
How many does she have left?

<<A simple illustration showing the story problem: Lila with 5 apples, buying 4 more, and then giving 3 away to a friend. The steps are shown visually with apples changing hands.>>

We can show it like this:
* Start with 5 + 4
* Then she gives away 3.

To show the whole problem as one equation, write:

    5 + 4 - 3 = ?

Or use a letter:

    5 + 4 - 3 = a

The letter a stands for the answer.

* Solve two-step word problems by doing operations in the correct order.

## What Is a Two-Step Problem?
A two-step problem is a word problem that needs two math operations to solve.  
First, you do one operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide).  
Then, you use that answer in a second operation.

Let’s look at this word problem:

Stephen's mom gave him 2 plates with 3 donuts on each plate. One donut fell on the ground. How many donuts does Stephen have left?

We can break down the steps of this word problem by sentences in the order that they happen.

<<An image showing the story-based calculation of 2x3 - 1 = 5. First, an image of a boy with 2 plates of 3 donuts. Then, one donut on the floor. Finally, the same boy with two plates of donuts, now 5 donuts total.>>

Another good way to solve a two step problem is to draw a picture of what is happening.

| Stephen’s mom gave him 2 plates with 3 donuts on each plate. | One donut fell on the ground. | How many donuts does Stephen have left? |
|---|---|---|
| 2 x 3 | - 1 | = ? |
| Draw two groups of 3 donuts (or just circles). | Cross one out. | Count how many are left. |
| <<A schematic image of six donuts in two groups.>> | <<A schematic image of six donuts in two groups. One donut is crossed out.>> | <<A schematic image of two groups of donuts; one of 3 donuts and one of 2.>> |
| 6 | - 1 | = 5 |

## Hidden Multipliers
Sometimes the problem hides the math inside words. A hidden multiplier is the number that tells how many are in each group. We don’t always see it written, but it’s there!

Here are some everyday examples:

| Group        | Hidden Multiplier | Example Question                   | Multiplication | Total    |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| week         | 7 days            | How many days in 3 weeks?          | 3 × 7         | 21 days  |
| pair of shoes| 2 shoes           | How many shoes in 5 pairs?         | 5 × 2         | 10 shoes |
| dog          | 4 legs            | How many legs on 6 dogs?           | 6 × 4         | 24 legs  |
| spider       | 8 legs            | How many legs on 2 spiders?        | 2 × 8         | 16 legs  |
| bicycle      | 2 wheels          | How many wheels on 4 bicycles?     | 4 × 2         | 8 wheels |
| tricycle     | 3 wheels          | How many wheels on 3 tricycles?    | 3 × 3         | 9 wheels |

**Quick Check:** There are 2 weeks and 5 days until Juan's birthday. How many days is that in all?
**Click to see answer:**
19 days. 2 weeks have 7 days each, so 2 × 7 + 5 = 19

### Reasonable Answers

When you solve a word problem, you want to check if your answer **makes sense**.

An answer is **reasonable** if it is close to what you would expect.

One way to check reasonableness is by using numbers that are very close to the numbers in the problem, but are easy to work with.

**Examples:**
- Instead of 19 + 32, think of 20 + 30.
- Instead of 87 – 39, think of 90 – 40.

**Let’s try it:**

Leo has saved $119 for holiday gifts.
He wants to buy gifts for 4 people. He plans to spend about $20 on each.
Leo estimates he will have around $80 left. Is that a good estimate?

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Multiply 20 by 4.
2. Subtract the answer from 119.

We can multiply 20 × 4 to find the amount Leo will spend on gifts.
20 × 4 = $80
So he spent $80 on gifts.

Now, subtract 119 – 80 to find how much he has left.
Since 119 is close to 120 and 120 is easier to work with, we can do 120 – 80 = $40.
An estimate of $80 would be much too high.

### Checking Estimates in Word Problems

**Worked Example**

At a cafe, there are 9 tables with 2 seats.
There is also 1 big round table with 9 seats.
The manager estimates that is about 20 seats in total.
Is that a good estimate?

**Step 1:** To check the estimate, find about how many seats there are.
Use numbers that are easy to work with and that are close to the numbers in the problem.

19 × 2 = 18
That is about 20 seats.
There is also 1 big round table with 9 seats.
That is about 10 seats.
Add to find about how many seats there are in total.
20 + 10 = 30
There are about 30 seats in total.

**Step 2:** Compare the estimate with your answer.

There are about 30 seats in total, but the estimate was 20.
So the estimate was much too low.

**Guided Practice**

In the library, there are 7 shelves with 4 books each.

### Checking Estimates for Division in Word Problems

**Worked Example**

Meghan had a bag of 82 beads, and she found 19 more beads in her closet.
She wants to take all those beads and make 10 necklaces for friends.
She estimates each necklace can use about 18 beads.
Is that a good estimate?

**Step 1:** To check the estimate, find about how many beads each necklace can use.
Use numbers that are easy to work with and that are close to the numbers in the problem.

82 + 19 is about 80 + 20 = 100.
These beads will be divided among 10 necklaces.
Divide to find about how many beads each necklace can use.
100 ÷ 10 = 10
Each necklace can use about 10 beads.

**Step 2:** Compare the estimate with your answer.

Each necklace can use about 10 beads, but the estimate is 18.
This estimate is much too high.

**Guided Practice**

Sam collected 68 stickers, and then he found 11 more stickers in his desk.
He wants to share all the stickers equally among 8 friends.
He estimates each friend can get about 12 stickers.
Is that a good estimate?

**Step 1:** To check the estimate, find about how many stickers each friend can get.

### Input/Output Machines and Rules

Imagine a robot that takes in a number, follows a special rule, and gives you a new number.

<<A friendly robot accepting a number and outputting a new number according to a rule.>>

<<Visual showing the rule 'multiply by 5', such as an arrow pointing from an input number to an output number, labeled with '×5'.>>

For example, let’s look at the rule, “multiply by 5.”

The input/output table would look like this:

<<A simple input/output table with numbers showing the input and the output after multiplying by 5.>>

### How to Find the Right Rule

All the tables in this lesson use multiplication.
Since we already know we are multiplying, we just need to figure out what number we are multiplying by.

1. Pick any input from the table and look at its output.
2. Think: *What number do I multiply the input by to get that output?*
3. Check other rows to see if the same multiplication works each time.

**Quick Check:** If the input is 8 and the output is 32, what could the rule be?
**Click to see answer:** Multiply by 4, because 8 × 4 = 32.

The lesson follows a Concrete–Pictorial–Abstract (CPA) sequence.  
1. Concrete: Students use counters or base-ten blocks to build equal groups and physically “take apart” the groups to model division.  
2. Pictorial: Students transfer the concrete work to strip diagrams and simple in/out tables drawn on dry-erase boards.  
3. Abstract: Students analyze numerical in/out tables and verbal rules written as “Divide by ___.” They use reasoning and fact fluency to match each division rule to the correct table.  
Throughout, the teacher explicitly links multiplication facts to their related division facts (e.g., if 6 × 4 = 24, then 24 ÷ 6 = 4), reinforcing the structure of the 10 × 10 fact family table and drawing attention to patterns (all quotients when dividing by 2 are even, etc.). Guided questioning and think-alouds model the six-step reasoning process listed at the end of this document. Turn-and-talks, mini whiteboard checks, and exit slips provide formative feedback.

## Prerequisite skills
• Fluent recall of multiplication facts 0–10  
• Understanding that division is “how many in each group” or “how many groups”  
• Ability to write and read simple in/out tables  
• Recognizing ascending order of whole numbers  
• Interpreting an arithmetic “rule” expressed in words or symbols (e.g., “÷3”)

## Microskills
• Identify the divisor (rule) in words or symbols  
• Relate a division fact to its partner multiplication fact  
• Determine whether one input–output pair fits a given division rule  
• Systematically test additional pairs for consistency  
• Narrow choices by eliminating non-matching tables  
• Justify a final choice using mathematical language (“Because 24 ÷ 6 = 4 and 30 ÷ 6 = 5, every pair in Table B follows ÷6.”)

Today, you will learn how to:
- Find and use addition rules from input/output tables
- Find and use subtraction rules from input/output tables

## LEARNING CONTENT

### Rules for Input/Output Tables

An input/output table uses one rule to change the input into the output.

In this table, the rule is add 5.

<<A cartoon robot demonstrates an input-output machine with the rule 'add 5,' showing input numbers 1 and 3 and their corresponding outputs 6 and 8, along with a matching table.>>

If you are given a table without the rule, you can find the rule by looking at the pattern between the input and output numbers.

### Addition Rules

**If you notice the rule makes the input increase to get the output, check for an addition rule.**

For example, let’s look at this table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|   0   |   2    |
|   1   |   3    |
|   2   |   4    |
|   3   |   5    |
|   4   |   6    |

The inputs are being increased to get the outputs.
0 + ? = 2
1 + ? = 3
2 + ? = 4
3 + ? = 5
4 + ? = 6

Finding the number being added to each input to get the output will give you the rule.
0 + 2 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 2 = 4
3 + 2 = 5
4 + 2 = 6

**So we know the rule is “add 2.”**

### Subtraction Rules

**If you notice the rule makes the input decrease to get the output, check for a subtraction rule.**

For example, let’s look at this table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|   4   |   1    |
|   9   |   6    |
|  13   |  10    |
|  18   |  15    |
|  20   |  17    |

The inputs are being decreased to get the outputs.
4 - ? = 1
9 - ? = 6
13 - ? = 10
18 - ? = 15
20 - ? = 17

Finding the number being subtracted from each input to get the output will give you the rule.
4 - 3 = 1
9 - 3 = 6
13 - 3 = 10
18 - 3 = 15
20 - 3 = 17

**So we know the rule is “subtract 3.”**

### Finding the Missing Number

To find the missing numbers from an input/output table, first find the rule.

**Example:**

<<Input/output table with some missing elements.>>

**First, identify the rule:**
For every input, 8 is added to it to get the output.
So the rule is Add 8.

**To find a missing output, apply the rule to the input:**
30 + 8 = 38

**To find a missing input, work backwards:**
What plus 8 is 36?
? + 8 = 36
We can solve this by solving the related math fact 36 - 8 = 28.
Now, we can fill in the table for the missing values.

<<A two-column input-output table with missing values filled in red, showing a numerical pattern for students to complete.>>

### Finding the Multiplication Rule

To find the rule, check the first row. What do you multiply the input by to get the output?

For example, in the table below, 2 is the input and 10 is the output.

<<Input/Output multiplication rule table (multiply by 5)>>

We want to know 2 × ? = 10.
We know 2 × 5 = 10, so the rule could be × 5.
Make sure the rule works for every row, not just the first.
4 × 5 = 20 ✅
6 × 5 = 30 ✅
8 × 5 = 40 ✅

### Finding the Division Rule

#### Example

What rule describes how each input is changed to its output?

<<A simple input/output table with blue headers and white text. Three rows of data: Input 24, Output 8; Input 18, Output 6; Input 15, Output 5. The table has clean black borders and sits on a white background.>>

**Step 1:** Look at the first row that shows both the input and output numbers.
Input: 24, Output: 8

**Step 2:** Find what number the input could be divided by to get the output.
24 ÷ ? = 8
24 ÷ 3 = 8 → It can be divided by 3.

**Step 3:** Make sure it works for every row.
18 ÷ 3 = 6
15 ÷ 3 = 5

**Step 4:** State the rule.
The rule is: ÷ 3

#### Practice

What rule describes how each input is changed to its output?

<<A matching input/output table with the same blue header design. Three rows showing: Input 35, Output 7; Input 20, Output 4; Input 10, Output 2. Same clean formatting as the worked example.>>

## Prerequisite Skills  
• Fluently recall multiplication and division facts for 0–10.  
• Understand the meaning of the ÷ symbol and the terms dividend, divisor, and quotient.  
• Read and interpret simple input/output tables (columns labeled or implied).  
• Recognize that a “rule” is the operation that consistently changes every input into its output.  
• Locate and use corresponding values in the same row of a table.  

## Microskills  
• Determine the operation used in an input/output table by examining one complete row.  
• Use fact‐family reasoning to find a missing divisor (e.g., if 24 → 8, think 24 ÷ ? = 8).  
• Confirm a suspected rule by testing it on additional rows.  
• Express a rule in words ( “divide by 4”) and symbols ( “÷ 4”).  
• Apply the discovered rule to generate or check additional outputs.  
• Explain, verbally or in writing, why the rule works for every pair in the table.  
• Self-check answers by reversing the operation (multiply output × divisor = input).  
• Recognize that inputs may rise in uneven steps; the constancy is in the rule, not the intervals.  

## Precise Vocabulary

## Finding Missing Terms in Patterns

Sometimes the input/output table is missing a number, and you have to figure out what it should be.

## Missing Outputs

**When an output is missing:**
1. Find the rule by looking at the other input/output pairs.
2. Apply that rule to the input to find the missing output.

This works no matter where the missing number is.

## Even and Odd Numbers

We know that all numbers are either even or odd.

* If they are even, they end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
* And if they are odd, they end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

Let’s look at some patterns for when we are multiplying even and odd numbers together.

<<A table showing multiplication examples with even × even, even × odd, odd × even, and odd × odd. Examples: 2 × 4 = 8, 2 × 3 = 6, 3 × 4 = 12, 5 × 7 = 35, etc.>>

We can see the following patterns:
- even × even = even
- odd × odd = odd
- even × odd = even
- odd × even = even

We can use these rules to find out if two numbers being multiplied together will be even or odd before even finding the answer.

What is Rounding?
Rounding is when we change a number to one that is easier to work with but still close to the original number.

Let’s say you have 48 trading cards. If you tell someone, “I have about 50 trading cards,” that’s rounding! You didn’t count them wrong—you just gave an estimate that is around the same as the exact number.

How to Round
1. Find the place value you are rounding to (tens, hundreds).
2. Use a number line that counts by that place value.
3. Find where your number goes on the number line.
4. See which labeled number it’s closest to on the number line.

If your number is exactly in the middle between two labeled numbers, round up to the bigger number.

**Example:** Round 48 to the nearest 10.

Step 1: Identify which place value we are rounding to – the tens place.
Step 2: Use a number line that counts by tens.
<<Empty number line showing segment between 0 and 100.>>
Step 3: Graph your given number, 48.
<<Number line with a dot on number 48.>>
Step 4: 48 is between the tens 40 and 50, and it is closer to 50, so 48 rounds to 50.

Rounding to the Nearest 10

**Example 1: Round 71 to the nearest 10**
<<Number line with a dot on number 71.>>
Step 1: Which two tens is the number 71 between?
70 and 80
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
70
So, 71 rounds to 70.

**Example 2: Round 35 to the nearest 10**
<<Number line with a dot on number 35.>>
Step 1: Which two tens is the number 35 between?
30 and 40
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
It is exactly in the middle and when that happens, we always round up.
40
So, 35 rounds to 40.

**Example 3: Round 318 to the nearest 10**
<<Number line with a dot on number 318.>>
Step 1: Which two tens is the number 318 between?
310 and 320
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
320
So, 318 rounds to 320.

Rounding to the Nearest 100

**Example 1: Round 742 to the nearest 100**
<<Number line with a dot on number 742.>>
Step 1: Which two hundreds is the number 742 between?
700 and 800
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
700
So, 742 rounds to 700.

**Example 2: Round 668 to the nearest 100**
<<Number line with a dot on number 668.>>
Step 1: Which two hundreds is the number 668 between?
600 and 700
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
700
So, 668 rounds to 700.

**Example 3: Round 98 to the nearest 100**
<<Number line with a dot on number 98.>>
Step 1: Which two hundreds is the number 98 between?
0 and 100
Step 2: Which is it closest to?
100
So, 98 rounds to 100.

## What is Rounding?

**Rounding** means changing a number to the nearest place value, like the nearest ten or hundred, so it’s easier to work with.

---

## Rounding to the Nearest 10

To **round** to the nearest 10, follow these steps:
1. Find the tens place.
2. Look at the ones place (the number to the right).
    - If it’s 5 or more → add 1 to the tens place.
    - If it’s 4 or less → keep the tens place the same.
3. Change the ones place to 0.

Examples:
- 2<u>4</u> → 20
- 5<u>7</u> → 60
- 23<u>4</u> → 230
- 84<u>5</u> → 850

---

## Rounding to the Nearest 100

To **round** to the nearest 100, you can follow almost the same steps:
1. Find the hundreds place.
2. Look at the tens place (the number to the right).
    - If it’s 5 or more → add 1 to the hundreds place.
    - If it’s 4 or less → keep the hundreds place the same.
3. Change the ones and tens places to 0.

Examples:
- 2<u>5</u>9 → 300
- 6<u>1</u>7 → 600

**Here's the trick to remember:**

**Five or more, let it soar. Four or less, let it rest.**

- Apply the digit rule: look one place to the right (0–4 stay; 5–9 round up).
- Replace lower-place digits with zeros after rounding.
- Regroup when adding 1 causes a carry (e.g., 99 → 100; 995 → 1,000).
- Recognize numbers already multiples of 10 or 100 (stay the same).
- Justify the rounded result with “closer to” language or a number line.
- Check reasonableness quickly (e.g., 627 ≈ 630; 564 ≈ 600).

## Precise Vocabulary
- Round: adjust a number to the closest value at a named place.
- Nearest 10: the closest multiple of 10 to a number.
- Nearest 100: the closest multiple of 100 to a number.
- Ones/Tens/Hundreds digit: the digit in the ones/tens/hundreds place.
- Place value: value of a digit based on its position.
- Multiple of 10/100: numbers like 10, 20, … or 100, 200, …
- Midpoint/Halfway: exactly in the middle between two benchmarks (5 for tens; 50 for hundreds).
- Number line: a line that shows number positions to compare closeness.
- Regroup/Carry: move to the next place when a place value reaches 10.

## Estimating Sums and Differences with Rounding

**What Does Estimate Mean?**  
An estimate is a guess about what the answer might be.  
Estimates are useful when we want to know about how many or about how much without solving exactly.  
When we guess a number, we want it to be close to the real answer. Rounding helps us do that.

<<examples of Estimating Sums (Addition) & Estimating Differences (Subtraction), 2 digits>>

**Estimating Sums and Differences of Three Digit Numbers**  
When we are working with three digit numbers, we want to round to the nearest hundred.

<<examples of Estimating Sums (Addition) & Estimating Differences (Subtraction), 3 digits>>

## Choosing the Best Estimate in Word Problems

Sometimes word problems ask us to estimate the answer.

**Example:**  
The students at a school raised 560 silkworms.  
176 turned into moths.  
About how many silkworms did not turn into moths?  
The word, “about” is our clue that we should estimate and that we don’t need to find the exact answer.

- **Think**, we are finding “how many did not,” so we subtract.
- **Round** 560 to 600.
- **Round** 176 to 200.
- **Estimate** 600 – 200 = 400.
- So, about 400 silkworms did not turn into moths.

## What Is an Estimate

An **estimate** is an approximate answer that is close to the exact answer. When we estimate, we use **rounding** to make numbers easier to work with. This helps us quickly find an answer that is close to the real answer without doing hard math.

**Quick Check:** Choose the word that means ""an approximate answer that is close to the exact answer"": calculation, estimate, or measurement?

## Rounding Numbers for Estimation

To estimate sums and differences, we first **round** each number to the nearest ten or hundred. For two-digit numbers, we usually round to the nearest ten. For three-digit numbers, we can round to the nearest ten or hundred depending on what makes the math easier.

OBJECTIVES

Today, you will learn how to:
* Use models to add three-digit numbers

### Regrouping

Sometimes when you are adding, you will find that one place value has more than ten and regrouping is necessary.
We know that for every ten ones, we can regroup them into one ten.

<<Ten red unit cubes grouped and shown as equal to one yellow tens rod. Text reads 'Ten Ones = One Ten'.>>

The same is true for the tens. For every ten tens, we can regroup them as one hundred.

<<Ten yellow tens rods grouped and shown as equal to one blue hundreds flat. Text reads 'Ten Tens = One Hundred'.>>

### Adding with Regrouping

Let’s look at an example that involves regrouping.

<<Base-ten block model adding 267 and 177, showing all hundreds, tens, and ones blocks together before regrouping.>>

There are 3 hundreds blocks, 13 tens blocks, and 14 ones blocks in all.

<<Blocks are now grouped as 3 hundreds, 13 tens, and 14 ones. Numbers below read 300 + 130 + 14.>>

Regroup 10 of the ones as 1 ten. There are 4 ones left over.
You now have one more ten. That makes 14 tens in all.

<<Blocks after regrouping 10 ones as 1 ten: 3 hundreds blocks, 14 tens blocks, 4 ones blocks. 300 + 140 + 4.>>

Then, regroup 10 of the tens as 1 hundred. There are 4 tens left over.
You now have one more hundred. That makes 4 hundreds in all.

<<Final regrouping: blocks now show 4 hundreds, 4 tens, 4 ones. Below reads 400 + 40 + 4.>>

So, there are 4 hundreds, 4 tens, and 4 ones after you regroup. This is the same as 444.
267 + 177 = 444

Today, you will learn how to:
* Add multi-digit numbers using base-ten blocks to show your work

## 2. LEARNING CONTENT

### Understanding Base-Ten Blocks

Base-ten blocks are special tools that help us see numbers. Each block represents a different place value. Unit cubes show ones, rods show tens, and flat squares show hundreds.

<<A colorful illustration showing three types of base-ten blocks arranged in a row: small yellow unit cubes labeled ""ones,"" blue rectangular rods labeled ""tens,"" and large red flat squares labeled ""hundreds."" The blocks should be drawn in a clean, educational style with clear labels underneath each type. The background should be white with a subtle grid pattern.>>

### Setting Up Place Value Columns

When adding with base-ten blocks, we organize them into three columns: hundreds, tens, and ones. This keeps our blocks neat and helps us add correctly.

**Quick Check:** Look at the number 347. Which column would you put 3 hundreds blocks in? Which column would you put 4 tens blocks in? Which column would you put 7 ones blocks in?

*Answer: 3 hundreds blocks go in the hundreds column, 4 tens blocks go in the tens column, and 7 ones blocks go in the ones column.*

### Understanding When to Regroup

Regrouping happens when we have 10 or more blocks in any column. We trade 10 ones blocks for 1 tens block, or 10 tens blocks for 1 hundreds block.

<<A step-by-step diagram showing regrouping in action: the left side shows 12 yellow unit cubes (ones blocks) scattered in the ones column, an arrow pointing right, and the right side shows 1 blue tens rod and 2 yellow unit cubes neatly arranged. Text above reads ""12 ones becomes 1 ten and 2 ones."" The style should be clean and educational with bright, distinct colors.>>

- Subtract numbers up to 1,000

## Subtracting without Regrouping
To solve subtraction problems:
- Line up the place values.
- Beginning from the ones place, subtract each digit.

**Example:** 951 - 730 = ?

<<A subtraction problem showing 951 minus 730, with place values lined up.>>

## Subtracting with Regrouping
Sometimes the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit in a value place. In those cases we should regroup.

**Example:** 458 - 369 = ?

In these cases:
- Line up the place values.

<<Place value chart showing 458 minus 369 lined up by hundreds, tens, and ones.>>

- Subtract the values in the ones place, regrouping from the tens place if needed.

<<Place value chart for 458 minus 369, ones subtraction completed, regrouped from tens. Color-coded.>>

- Subtract the values in the tens place, regrouping from the hundreds place if necessary.

<<Place value chart for 458 minus 369, tens subtraction highlighted, regrouped from hundreds. Color-coded.>>

- Subtract the values in the hundreds place.

<<Place value chart for 458 minus 369, hundreds subtraction highlighted. Color-coded.>>

So 458 - 369 = 89.

","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. “Align to Subtract”  (easy)  
What students see  
• A blank vertical-subtraction workspace with three narrow columns labelled H  T  O.  
• Two numbers, e.g.,  362   and  47, shown as loose digit tiles: 3, 6, 2, 4, 7.  
Task  
Drag each digit tile into the correct place-value column to build the complete problem before it can be solved. (The system checks only the alignment, not the final difference.)  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The action of physically lining digits up by place value cannot be captured by a text box or a single-choice option; the assessment goal is the placement itself, not the typed numbers. It directly probes the strategy prerequisite for fluent subtraction within 1 000.

2. “Build-the-Difference Blocks”  (medium)  
What students see  
• A starter picture of 254 base-ten blocks already laid out in a “Start” tray (2 hundreds, 5 tens, 4 ones).  
• A label “Take away 178”.  
• An empty “Difference” tray.  
• A draggable bank containing exactly the blocks that should remain after subtracting 178 (1 hundred, 7 tens converted to tens/ones as needed, etc.) mixed with distractor blocks.  
Task  
Drag the blocks that represent the final difference into the “Difference” tray.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The item checks conceptual regrouping (exchanging one hundred for ten tens, etc.) through a concrete model. Selecting a radio button or typing an answer would bypass the requirement to show that regrouping understanding.

3. “Sequence the Regrouping”  (medium)  
What students see  
• Five snapshot cards showing successive, unlabeled stages of subtracting 603 − 458 with the standard algorithm (original setup, crossing out the 0 and 6, writing 9 and 10, etc.). The cards are shuffled.  
Task  
Drag the cards into the tray so they appear in the correct chronological order.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must recognize and order each nuanced regrouping step; this temporal sequencing cannot be duplicated by a single multiple-choice question or simple text entry.

4. “Fill the Borrowed Digits”  (hard)  
What students see  
• A vertical subtraction problem already partly worked:  

    4 1 _  
   5 6 7  
 −  3 8 9  
   ————  

  The strokes that show regrouping are present, but the four digits created by crossing-out and writing new values are blank.  
• A digit bank (0–9) with each digit as a draggable tile.  
Task  
Drag the correct digits to every blank so that the regrouping is accurate (41 becomes 3 11, then 10, etc.). The system does not ask for the final answer—only the intermediate borrowed digits.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The learner must decide which digit goes in each specific micro-location (cross-out vs. rewrite). A fill-in box would reduce the task to typing numbers without demonstrating spatial understanding of where each borrowed value belongs.

These four item types all demand physical placement or ordering—actions that directly embody place-value reasoning and regrouping—making drag and drop uniquely appropriate for assessing fluent subtraction within 1 000.","1. Quick-Scan “No-Borrow” Sort  – easy  
Prompt:  
Below are eight subtraction problems. Select ALL the problems that can be solved without any regrouping.  

Why multiselect is essential  
• More than one (usually 3–4) of the expressions fit the rule; asking for “which one” or a single text entry would miss the point of having to test each place-value comparison.  
• Students must reason about every option’s ones, tens, and hundreds digits—demonstrating place-value fluency rather than computing a single difference.  

Coverage of sub-tasks  
• Includes two-digit minus two-digit (e.g., 73 – 25) and three-digit minus three-digit (e.g., 642 – 421) items.  
• Mixes cases where the minuend has trailing zeros (e.g., 580 – 243) to be sure students aren’t just eye-balling the first digits.  

2. Spot-the-Accurate Difference  – medium  
Prompt:  
Six classmates each solved a subtraction problem and wrote both the vertical work and the final answer. Select ALL of the classmates whose answer is correct.  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Several of the displayed solutions are correct; several contain typical regrouping blunders (borrowing from the wrong digit, forgetting to decrease the tens, etc.).  
• Requiring students to examine every solution mirrors peer-review reasoning and cannot be distilled to a single “right letter.”  

Coverage of sub-tasks  
• Problems mix:  
  – two-digit from three-digit (e.g., 413 – 78) requiring regrouping,  
  – three-digit minus three-digit without regrouping,  
  – three-digit minus three-digit with regrouping across multiple places.  

3. Match-the-Target Difference  – medium  
Prompt:  
The target difference is 368. Select ALL subtraction expressions whose value equals 368.  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Students must actually perform or mentally decompose several different problems; at least three produce 368.  
• Cannot be replaced by MCQ because there are multiple correct expressions and the focus is on strategy choice, not merely identifying one match.  

Coverage of sub-tasks  
• Examples include:  
  – 905 – 537 (three-digit w/ regrouping),  
  – 712 – 344 (three-digit w/o regrouping),  
  – 386 – 18  (two-digit from three-digit, regrouping).  
Ensures representation of every subtraction type in the standard.  

4. Algorithm Detective: Valid Decompositions  – hard  
Prompt:  
Shown below are five different step-by-step place-value breakdowns for 304 – 187. Each set shows how someone decomposed numbers or regrouped before recording the final difference. Select ALL decompositions that would lead to the correct answer.  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Multiple decompositions can be simultaneously valid (e.g., subtract 100 then 80 then 7; or decompose 304 to 2 hundreds + 9 tens + 14 ones first).  
• Evaluating which sequences are logically sound assesses deep understanding of place-value algorithms—impossible with single-response formats.  

Coverage of sub-tasks  
• Provides a subtraction that certainly needs regrouping across zeros (three-digit minus three-digit), the hardest case in the 3.NBT.A.2 boundary.",#REF!

### How to Know When to Add or Subtract

Sometimes you read word problems with three-digit numbers and need to know if you should add or subtract. Remember, if you are putting amounts together, you want to add them to make a bigger total.

If you are taking something away or comparing two amounts to see how many more, you want to subtract.

Answer: 328 toys","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Fill-the-Bar Model   (easy)  
What the student sees  
• A part–part–whole bar diagram with three empty drop zones: Part A, Part B, Whole.  
• A short word problem whose solution is two-digit addition without regrouping (e.g., “A farm sold 26 ears of corn in the morning and 43 in the afternoon. How many ears were sold altogether?”).  
• A bank of 8 draggable number tiles: the two addends, the correct total, and five plausible distractors (all within 100).  

Drag action (single focus)  
Students drag one number tile into each of the three bar-model zones.  

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The item simultaneously checks (a) selection of the relevant quantities from the story, (b) correct classification of each number as a part or the whole, and (c) accurate computation of the total. There are 8 × 7 × 6 = 336 possible placements, so a simple MCQ or single numeric entry cannot capture the same reasoning depth or mis-classification errors.  

Assessed task type: add two two-digit numbers, no regrouping, drawn from a word problem.  


2. Pallet Pickup Regrouping   (medium)  
What the student sees  
• A shipping story such as “A warehouse has 347 toys on Pallet A and adds 286 toys from Pallet B. Drag blocks to show how many toys are on the combined pallet.”  
• A “pallet” workspace.  
• A draggable bank of base-ten blocks: unlimited hundreds flats, tens rods, ones cubes.  

Drag action (single focus)  
Students drag blocks into the pallet until it shows the total amount. They may regroup tens into hundreds or ones into tens by swapping blocks (a built-in mechanic). The system scores by counting the final configuration.  

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must execute the regrouping physically; the software can capture whether the student tried to add 3 + 2 hundreds, 4 + 8 tens (and regroup), etc. Mis-regrouping patterns are diagnosable only through the manipulative action, not through a lone answer box or MCQ.  

Assessed task type: add two three-digit numbers with regrouping, drawn from a word problem.  


3. Open-Number-Line Jump-Off   (medium)  
What the student sees  
• A blank open number line from 0 to 1 000 with the starting number already pinned (e.g., 902).  
• A zoo scenario: “The zoo printed 902 tickets. They sold 578. Show the jumps to find how many are left.”  
• A tray containing draggable jump arrows labelled −500, −70, −8, −600, −80, −20, etc. (several ways to compose 578 plus distractors).  

Drag action (single focus)  
Students drag one or more arrows onto the line so the endpoint lands exactly at the unknown result.  

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The task captures the student’s chosen decomposition of the subtrahend and highlights regrouping errors (e.g., picking −500, −70, −9). Spatial placement and multi-component choice cannot be mimicked by MCQ, and a single numeric entry would give no insight into the subtraction strategy.  

Assessed task type: subtract a three-digit number (with regrouping) from a three-digit starting number, drawn from a word problem.  


4. Balloon Inventory Builder   (hard)  
What the student sees  
• Story with extraneous data and mixed operations, e.g.:  
  “At the festival there were 215 red balloons, 132 blue balloons, 89 green balloons, and 40 purple kites. Later, 57 balloons popped. How many balloons are left?”  
• An expression rail with six empty slots.  
• A bank of draggable tiles: number tiles (215, 132, 89, 40, 57, 379, 436, 504), and operation tiles (+, −).  

Drag action (single focus)  
Students drag exactly the numbers and operation symbols they need, in the correct order, to build a complete equation that equals the final number of balloons (e.g., 215 + 132 + 89 − 57 = 379).  

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must (a) sift relevant from irrelevant data, (b) choose correct operations, and (c) compute the result—all demonstrated through tile placement. The combinatorial number of possible strings of tiles makes the item impossible to replicate with standard MCQ lists, and the work-shown requirement exceeds what a single fill-in blank can evaluate.  

Assessed task type: multi-addend addition followed by subtraction (both within 1 000, requiring regrouping), extracted from a word problem with extraneous information.","1. “Which Equations Solve the Picnic Problem?” ‑ easy  
Word problem on-screen:  
“At the school picnic, there are 47 sandwiches on the red blanket and 32 sandwiches on the blue blanket.  How many sandwiches are there in all?”  

Answer area (multi-select): six different number sentences are shown.  
• 47 + 32 = 79 ✔  
• 32 + 47 = 79 ✔  
• 40 + 30 + 7 + 2 = 79 ✔  
• 79 − 47 = 32 ✔  
• 47 + 30 = 77 ✖  
• 79 − 32 = 56 ✖  

Why multiselect is indispensable: More than one equation truly represents (or checks) the same add-to situation, so the task demands “select all that apply.”  A single MCQ could not test simultaneous recognition of every correct form, and a text-entry box would capture only one of them, not a set of equivalent equations.

2. “Whose Work Is Right? – Pencils in the Cabinet” ‑ medium  
Word problem on-screen:  
“There are 256 pencils in the green cabinet and 478 pencils in the blue cabinet.  How many pencils are there altogether?”  

Four student solution images are provided (quick sketches of standard algorithm, partial-sums method, open‐number-line, etc.).  
• Student A shows 256 + 478 = 634 (carry done correctly) ✔  
• Student B shows 256 + 478 = 724 (added hundreds incorrectly) ✖  
• Student C shows 478 + 256 = 734 (tens carried twice) ✖  
• Student D shows 200 + 400 + 50 + 70 + 6 + 8 = 634 ✔  

Prompt: “Select ALL students whose work correctly solves the problem.”  

Why multiselect is indispensable: Learners must judge each strategy and answer, not simply pick the single best one.  Only the multiselect format lets them affirm both correct solutions simultaneously while rejecting the wrong ones.

3. “Choose All Correct Ways to Find the Apples Left” ‑ medium  
Word problem on-screen:  
“Maria picked 423 apples.  She sold 78 apples at the market.  How many apples does she have left?”  

Answer area (multi-select): five statements are listed.  
• 423 − 78 = 345 ✔  
• 400 + 20 + 3  minus 70 + 8  equals 300 + 40 + 5 ✔  
• 78 + 345 = 423 ✔  
• 423 − 70 = 353 ✖  
• 423 − 80 = 343 ✖  

Why multiselect is indispensable: Multiple correct numeric representations (difference, add-back check, decomposed subtraction) coexist.  Students must recognize every valid route/no regroup vs. regroup missteps, which cannot be captured by one MC choice or a single numeric entry.

### What Are Unit Fractions

A **unit fraction** is a special type of fraction that always has the number 1 on top.

- The top number is called the **numerator**.
- The bottom number is called the **denominator**.
- Unit fractions mean one of the equal parts is shaded or taken.

**Quick Check:** Choose the unit fractions: 1/3, 2/4, 1/8, 3/6, 1/2  
**Click to see answer:** 1/3, 1/8, 1/2 (These all have 1 as the numerator)

### Reading Unit Fractions in Models

When you see a fraction model, count the total number of equal parts. This number is the **denominator**.

If exactly one part is shaded, you have a **unit fraction**.

<<A colorful illustration showing three different shapes: a circle divided into 4 equal parts with 1 part shaded blue, a rectangle divided into 6 equal parts with 1 part shaded red, and a triangle divided into 3 equal parts with 1 part shaded green. Each model has the corresponding unit fraction written below it: 1/4, 1/6, and 1/3 respectively. The unshaded parts are outlined in black with light gray fill.>>

The lesson centers on helping Grade 3 students visually recognize and name unit fractions (1/b) when given a model and, conversely, select or produce a model when given a unit fraction. All work stays within the assessment boundary: denominators 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 only and the use of fraction models in which exactly one part is shaded or removed.

## Prerequisite skills
• Count reliably to at least 8.  
• Recognize and name basic 2-D shapes (circle, square, rectangle, hexagon, etc.).  
• Understand “whole” vs. “part.”  
• Understand that equal shares of the same whole have the same size.  
• Read and write simple fractions in the form 1/b (spoken as “one-something”).  
• Identify shaded areas in a picture.

## Microskills
• Determine whether parts in a model are equal in size.  
• Count the total number of equal parts that make up the whole.  
• Verify that exactly one part is shaded, removed, or highlighted.  
• Build the fraction 1/b by writing 1 as the numerator and the count of parts as the denominator.  
• Read a given unit fraction and interpret the denominator as “how many equal parts in the whole.”  
• Scan multiple models to find one that meets both conditions: correct number of equal parts AND only one part shaded.  
• Ignore distractions such as shape orientation, color choices, or location of the shaded part.  
• Explain the match using precise vocabulary (e.g., “There are six equal parts and one is shaded, so the model shows one-sixth.”).

## Precise Vocabulary
fraction – a number that names equal parts of a whole.  
unit fraction – a fraction with a numerator of 1 (e.g., 1/4).

* Represent fractions of a number line that show one of the equal parts

## Fractions of a Number Line

We know that fractions show equal parts of a whole.

<<Three rectangles showing 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 shaded to represent unit fractions>>

We can also represent these fractions on a number line. Let's look at the fraction 1/4.

<<Fraction 1/4 with arrows showing 1 shaded part and 4 total parts>>

When we split one whole into equal parts, each piece is a fraction of the whole.

<<A number line from 0-1 broken up into quarters, visually aligned with a unit bar broken up into quarters.>>

So we can represent a fraction on the number line like this:

<<Visual without description>>

Since each equal part has length 1/4, it doesn't matter which segment is highlighted, they each represent 1/4.

So each of these number lines represents 1/4:

<<Four number lines from 0-1 divided into fourths. Each number line has a different fourth highlighted to show they are all equivalent.>>

## Use the examples on the left to help you solve the practice problems on the right. Then, check your work!

### Matching Fractions to Number Lines

**Worked Example:**
Which number lines show a colored segment with a length of 1/4?

<<Three horizontal number lines. Line A divided into 2 parts with a segment from 0 to one-half; Line B divided into 4 parts with a segment from 0 to one-quarter; Line C divided into 8 parts with a segment from 0 to one-eighth.>>

**Step 1:** Identify what you are looking for from the numerator and denominator.
Answer: Since the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 4, we need a number line where 1 out of the 4 equal parts is highlighted.

**Step 2:** Find the number line that matches.
Answer: Line B is divided into 4 equal parts and 1 part is highlighted. So, line B shows 1/4.

**Guided Practice:**
Which number lines show a colored segment with a length of 1/8?

<<Three horizontal number lines from 0 to 1, labelled A, B and C: Line A is divided into 6 equal parts with a segment from 0 to 1⁄6; Line B into 8 parts with a segment from 0 to 1⁄8; Line C into 4 parts with a segment from 0 to 1⁄4.>>

**Step 1:** Identify what you are looking for from the numerator and denominator.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Unit Fractions on the Number Line

We know that a **unit fraction** is a fraction with:
- A **numerator** (top number) of 1
- A **denominator** (bottom number) tells how many equal parts make up one whole.

We can apply this same understanding to number lines.

<<Visual showing a number line from 0 to 1, split into 4 equal parts with segments and a label pointing to '1st part'. At the top left is a fraction 1/4, a bar with the first part shaded, and below is a horizontal number line with four segments, and a filled dot at the first tick.>>

## EXAMPLES OF UNIT FRACTIONS ON THE NUMBER LINE

<<Three number lines from 0 to 1 with fractional partitions: (A) split into thirds with the first tick labeled 1/3, (B) split into fifths with the first tick labeled 1/5, (C) split into fourths with the first tick labeled 1/4.>>

* Graph unit fractions on the number line

## From Models to the Number Line

Let’s look at how to represent unit fractions on number lines.

<<A single blue rectangle labeled '1 whole' above a number line from 0 to 1, showing the connection between a fraction bar model and a number line.>>

The number line shows fractions between 0 and 1.

Think of the number line like a stretched-out fraction bar:

- **0** is the “start” of the whole.
- **1** is the “end” of the whole.
- The space between 0 and 1 is the “whole bar.”

If we divide the bar into equal parts, we can divide the line the same way.

Blend direct instruction with hands-on modeling. Begin with a physical string or strip, label the ends 0 and 1, and let students fold or mark it to visualize equal parts. Transfer that concrete experience to a drawn number line, emphasizing that the length from 0 to 1 is one whole and that equal spacing is non-negotiable. Use repeated routines: read the denominator ➜ decide how many parts ➜ partition ➜ locate 1/b. Reinforce precision by having students check that all segments truly match before labeling any fraction. Finish with guided-to-independent practice moving from fully labeled tick marks to lines showing only endpoints.

Reading Fraction Models

When you see a fraction model, you need to count two things.
First, count all the equal parts to find the **denominator**.
Then count the shaded or selected parts to find the **numerator**.
The fraction is written as numerator over denominator.

<<Three fraction models with word fraction bar above, and symbolic fraction bar below each. Top: Fraction bar (""shaded parts""/""total parts""). Left: Circle, 3 of 4 slices shaded blue, with 3/4 below. Centre: Rectangle, 2 of 6 parts shaded green, with 2/6 below. Right: Row of 8 stars, 5 shaded yellow, with 5/8 below.>>

Use the examples on the left to help you solve the practice problems on the right. Then, check your work!

Reading Fraction Models

Example
Write the fraction shown by the shaded part of the model.

<<A rectangle divided into 8 equal vertical strips, with 3 strips shaded purple from left to right and 5 strips left white>>

**Step 1:** Count the total equal parts in the whole for the denominator.
There are 8 equal parts in the rectangle.

**Step 2:** Count the shaded parts for the numerator.
There are 3 shaded parts.

**Step 3:** Write the fraction as numerator/denominator.
The fraction is 3/8.

Practice
Write the fraction shown by the shaded part of the model.

<<Circle showing 4 of 6 equal slices shaded red (fraction 4/6)>>

**Step 1:** Count the total equal parts in the whole for the denominator.
**Click to see answer:**
There are 6 equal parts in the circle.

**Step 2:** Count the shaded parts for the numerator.
**Click to see answer:**
There are 4 shaded parts.

**Step 3:** Write the fraction as numerator/denominator.
**Click to see answer:**
The fraction is 4/6.

Matching Fractions to Models

Example
Which model matches the fraction 2/3?

<<Four different models labeled A, B, C, and D: A) A rectangle divided into 3 equal parts with 2 parts shaded blue, B) A rectangle divided into 4 equal parts with 2 parts shaded blue, C) A rectangle divided into 3 equal parts with 1 part shaded blue, D) A rectangle divided into 6 equal parts with 2 parts shaded blue>>

**Step 1:** Look at the fraction's numerator (top number) and determine how many parts should be shaded.
The fraction is 2/3, so the numerator is 2.

**Step 2:** Look at the fraction's denominator (bottom number) and determine how many total parts there should be.

### Real-World Fractions
We know a whole means 1 complete thing.

<<A rectangle divided into 1 whole part (image of one whole, no parts missing)>>

When we cut the whole into equal pieces, we can show a fraction (part of the whole).

Let’s look at the fraction 2/5.

<<A rectangle divided into 5 equal parts with 2 parts shaded>>

Word problems that match 2/5 say 2 parts out of 5 total.

Check out this table for some examples.

| Word Problem | Fraction Model                      | Answer                    |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| A sandwich is cut into 5 equal pieces. Ben eats 2 pieces. What fraction of the sandwich did Ben eat? | <<Two out of five parts shaded>> | 2/5 of the sandwich was eaten |
| A chocolate bar is divided into 5 equal sections. Two sections are broken off. What fraction of the chocolate bar broke off? | <<Two out of five parts shaded>> | 2/5 of the chocolate bar broke off |
| A running track is marked into 5 equal sections. An athlete runs 2 of the sections. What fraction of the track has he run? | <<Two out of five parts shaded>> | 2/5 of the track were run |

As you can see, the same fraction can show up in many different word problems.

### Finding the Whole Object

When you read a word problem about fractions, the first thing to look for is what whole object is being divided into parts. The whole object could be a pizza, a blanket, a chocolate bar, or any other item that can be split into equal pieces.

**Quick Check:** Read this sentence: ""Maria cuts her sandwich into 4 equal pieces and eats 1 piece."" What is the whole object being divided?

*Answer: The sandwich is the whole object being divided.*

### Counting Equal Parts for the Denominator

The denominator is the bottom number of a fraction. It tells you how many equal parts the whole object is divided into. Look for words like ""divided into,"" ""equal parts,"" ""equal pieces,"" or ""equal strips"" to find this number.

<<A colorful diagram showing three different whole objects: a circular pizza divided into 8 equal slices with dotted lines, a rectangular chocolate bar divided into 6 equal squares with grid lines, and a square blanket divided into 4 equal triangular sections with diagonal lines. Each object should be drawn in bright, appealing colors with clear division lines. The pizza should be golden brown with red sauce visible, the chocolate bar should be dark brown, and the blanket should be blue with colorful patterns.>>

### Finding the Parts Being Described for the Numerator

The numerator is the top number of a fraction. It tells you how many parts are being talked about in the problem. Look for action words like ""ate,"" ""used,"" ""colored,"" ""wet,"" or ""broken"" to find how many parts are being described.

**Quick Check:** In this sentence, ""Tom colors 3 out of 8 equal sections of his art project,"" what number should be the numerator?

*Answer: 3 should be the numerator because 3 sections are being colored.*

### Writing Fractions from Word Problems

Once you find the numerator and denominator, you can write the fraction. The numerator goes on top, and the denominator goes on the bottom. Remember that the denominator tells you the total equal parts, and the numerator tells you how many parts are being described.

<<A step-by-step visual showing the process of writing a fraction. Show a rectangle divided into 6 equal parts with 2 parts shaded in green. Next to it, show the fraction 2/6 being built with arrows pointing from the shaded parts to the numerator ""2"" and from all the parts to the denominator ""6"". Use clear, bold numbers in black text with green highlighting for the shaded portions.>>

### Matching Visual Models to Fractions

Visual models are pictures that show fractions using shapes, colors, or shading. To pick the right model, count the total equal parts first, then count the shaded or marked parts. The model that matches your fraction is the correct answer.

<<A comparison chart showing four different visual models side by side: a circle divided into 4 parts with 1 part shaded (representing 1/4), a rectangle divided into 3 parts with 2 parts shaded (representing 2/3), a hexagon divided into 6 parts with 3 parts shaded (representing 3/6), and a square divided into 8 parts with 5 parts shaded (representing 5/8). Each model should use consistent colors: unshaded parts in light gray and shaded parts in bright blue. Include the fraction written clearly below each model.>>

## Understanding Fourths on a Number Line

Remember, the number line that goes from 0 to 1 has a length of 1 whole.

<<A horizontal number line labeled from 0 to 1, divided into four equal segments to illustrate fourths.>>

When the number line is split into equal parts, we can count them to find the length of each part.

If we split it into 4 parts, then the number line is split into fourths, and each part is 1/4.

<<A number line divided into four equal segments, each labeled as one-fourth, with each segment visually highlighted to illustrate the concept of fourths.>>

If more than one fourth is shaded, count the shaded fourths—that number is the segment’s length.

Here are some examples:

<<Four horizontal fraction bars divided into four equal segments each, with one, two, three, and four segments shaded in red respectively to illustrate the fractions 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4.>>

Now look at these examples: even if different segments are shaded, order doesn’t matter—only how many.

For example, each of the following shows 3/4 because 3 of the 4 equal segments between 0 and 1 are shaded.

<<Four different fraction bar models each divided into four equal parts, with three segments shaded red in each to represent three-fourths, illustrating that the order of shaded segments does not affect the value of the fraction.>>

The numerator is the top number of a fraction. It tells how many parts are being counted or shaded. To find the numerator, start at the beginning of the shaded part on the number line and count each section until the end.
The denominator is the bottom number of a fraction. It tells how many equal parts the number line is divided into from 0 to 1. If the number line from 0 to 1 is split into 6 equal parts, the denominator is 6.

<<A horizontal number line from 0 to 1 divided into 6 equal parts. A segment spanning 3 consecutive parts should be highlighted in bright orange, starting from the first tick mark after 0. The highlighted segment should be clearly visible with a thick colored line. Numbers 0 and 1 should be labeled, and all tick marks should be evenly spaced.>>

**Quick Check:** A number line is divided into 4 equal parts, and 3 parts are highlighted. What fraction does this represent?
**Click to See Answer:** 3/4. The denominator is 4 because there are 4 equal parts total, and the numerator is 3 because 3 parts are highlighted.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Fractions Are Locations

A number line is like a road. Each fraction is a location on that road.
- 0 is the starting point.
- 1 is the ending point of one whole.
- Fractions are the tick marks in between.

<<Diagram box showing: Numerator is the number of jumps from 0 to the point. Denominator is the number of jumps from 0 to 1.>>

### Fractions Less Than One

Let’s take this number line for example:

<<Number line from 0 to 1 divided into four equal intervals, with a dot at the third tick mark.>>

<<Number line with three red arrows showing three jumps from 0 and four blue jumps from 0 to 1, illustrating three out of four jumps.>>

<<Text showing '3 jumps over 4 jumps = 3/4' to explain the meaning of 3/4 on the number line.>>

### Fractions Greater than One

Let’s try one where the fraction is greater than 1.

<<Number line from 0 to 11/6, divided into sixths, with a dot at 11/6.>>

Let’s fill in the fractions and count the jumps.

<<Number line from 0 to 11/6 divided into sixths, labeled with each fraction; nine jumps marked in red show 9/6.>>

<<Text illustrating '9 jumps over 6 jumps = 9/6' to explain what the improper fraction means.>>

## Prerequisite Skills  
• Count forward and backward on a number line using whole numbers through at least 24.  
• Recognize 0, 1, 2, and 3 as labeled points on a horizontal number line.  
• Partition shapes or sets into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 equal parts and name one part as a unit fraction (1/b).  
• Read and write fractions in a/b form; know that the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator.  
• Skip-count by 2s, 3s, 4s, 6s, and 8s.  
• Understand that moving right on a number line means increasing in value.  

## Microskills (explicitly taught in this lesson)  
• Draw or identify a horizontal number-line segment and label the endpoints 0 and 1 (extend to 2 or 3 when needed).  
• Partition the segment between consecutive whole numbers into b equal spaces where b = 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.  
• Label each tick mark with successive unit fractions (1/b, 2/b, 3/b, …).  
• Determine the denominator by counting the total equal spaces in one whole.  
• Determine the numerator by counting how many spaces (unit fractions) from 0 to the given point.  
• Express the location of a point as a proper fraction (value < 1) or an improper fraction (value > 1).  
• Recognize that an improper fraction “jumps” past 1 (or past 2, 3, …) but is still named with the same denominator.  
• Match a written fraction to a plotted point and vice-versa.  
• Explain verbally or in writing why a chosen fraction matches a given point (uses numerator / denominator reasoning, not length-measurement language only).

### Finding Halves on the Ruler

Look at the numbers on the ruler. Each big number is a whole inch.

<<A ruler showing only the full inch marks labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.>>

Between each whole number, we find the half-inch measurements.

Look at these half-inch measurements on the ruler below.

<<A ruler showing full inch marks and half-inch marks, with half-inches clearly labeled between the whole numbers.>>

### Finding Fourths on the Ruler

Fourths break the inch into 4 smaller pieces.

<<A ruler showing full inches, half-inches, and quarter-inches, with quarter-inch marks clearly labeled.>>

### Measuring on the Ruler

The object must line up with the ruler and start at 0.

The measurement is the number at the end of the object.

Here are some examples of everyday objects and their measurements:

Question: Which pencil is exactly 3 and 1/4 inches long? <<Visual: Four pencils, labeled A, B, C, and D, are aligned with the 0-inch line of a ruler that is marked in 1/4-inch increments. Pencil A’s tip stops at the 3-inch line. Pencil B’s tip stops at the first small tick past the 3-inch line (3 1/4 inches). Pencil C’s tip stops at the third small tick past the 3-inch line (3 3/4 inches). Pencil D’s tip stops at the first small tick past the 2-inch line (2 1/4 inches).>>   
Answer: Pencil B  
Answer Explanation:  
- Look at the ruler and find the 3-inch mark.  
- The ruler is divided into fourths, so each small tick after a whole number represents 1/4 inch.  
- 3 and 1/4 inches is one tick mark past the 3-inch line.  
- Check which pencil ends at this mark.  
- Pencil B’s tip is exactly at this position, so it is 3 and 1/4 inches long.  
- The other pencils do not end at this spot.

Question: What is the length of the paper clip to the nearest fourth of an inch? Write your answer as a mixed number or fraction. <<A paper clip is shown beside a ruler marked with halves and fourths of an inch. The paper clip starts at 0 inches and ends between the 2 and 2 ½-inch marks.>>  
Answer: 2 and 1/4 inches  
Answer Explanation:  
- Start by finding the last whole-inch mark before the end of the paper clip, which is 2 inches.  
- Then count the small divisions after 2 inches; each represents 1/4 inch.  
- The paper clip ends at the first tick after 2 inches, which is 2 and 1/4 inches.  
- Since the next tick is 2 and 1/2 inches, and the clip doesn’t reach that far, the nearest fourth is 2 and 1/4 inches.

Question Type: Text Entry  
Question: What is the length of the paintbrush? <<A paintbrush’s tip is at the 0 mark on a ruler marked in halves and fourths of an inch. Its end is halfway between the 5- and 6-inch marks.>>  
Answer: 5 and 1/2 inches  
Answer Explanation:  
- The paintbrush starts at 0 and ends in the middle of the space between 5 and 6 inches.  
- Halfway between two whole numbers is called a half.  
- So, you add 1/2 to 5 inches, making the length 5 and 1/2 inches.  
- You can see this on the ruler as the longest tick mark between 5 and 6.  
- It is also the same as 5 and 2/4 inches, but 5 and 1/2 is the simplest way to write it.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 3/4 in.","MCQ, Fraction Model, Text Entry, Drag and Drop","1. Slide-the-Ruler (easy)  
Students see a photo of a pencil lying horizontally. A single virtual 6-inch ruler (whole-, half-, and quarter-inch marks) sits off to the side. The only action possible is to drag/slide this ruler. The task prompt says: “Measure the pencil.” The student must drag the ruler so that the 0-mark aligns with the pencil’s eraser end and release it. The system scores by reading where the pencil’s tip intersects the ruler, within a small pixel tolerance of the correct ¼-inch mark. Because the answer is captured entirely by the final ruler position, no text entry or choosing among options is involved; alignment accuracy cannot be replicated by MCQ or fill-in-the-blank.

2. Build-with-Quarter Segments (medium)  
A blank measuring strip sits above the image of a stapler. Off to the left is a tray holding draggable ruler “sticks” scaled to screen size: 1 in, ½ in, and ¼ in pieces, each clearly marked. Students drag these sticks end-to-end, starting at the stapler’s left edge, until the assembled sticks exactly cover the stapler’s length (they snap together magnetically). The program totals the exact fractional length of the chain the student builds; only the correct combination (e.g., 3 in + 1¼ in) yields full credit. Constructing the chain forces students to attend to halves and fourths; neither MCQ nor a single typed value can capture the reasoning shown in the choice and placement of multiple fractional pieces.

3. Tag-the-Lengths (medium)  
Four small objects (eraser, paperclip, crayon, bolt) each rest above their own fixed horizontal ruler. A bank on the right contains eight draggable “length tags,” each displaying a fractional measurement (e.g., 1¼ in, 2½ in, 2¼ in, 3 in, etc.). Students drag one tag onto the drop zone beneath each object to show its length; four tags will remain unused. Because several tags are plausible distractors that differ by only ¼-inch, the student must actually read each ruler to decide. This multi-match drag interaction—many objects, many tags—cannot be replaced by a single MCQ or text box without losing the simultaneous, object-by-object measurement evidence.

4. Place-on-Number-Line (hard)  
A 0-to-6-inch number line with quarter-inch ticks stretches across the screen. Five thumbnails of differently sized cardboard strips sit above it. Students drag each strip so its left edge snaps to the 0-point; they then slide the right edge until it locks onto the tick that matches the strip’s length and release. When all five are placed, the system reads the anchor point of each right edge to determine the measurements. The item demands that students both measure and accurately translate each length to the corresponding fractional position—an interaction impossible to mirror with static answer formats.","1.  Pile-of-Ribbons (easy)  
   Students see five colored ribbon strips lying above the same inch ruler marked to fourths.  None of the strips start at 0; the ruler shows each actual endpoint.  
   Prompt: “Select ALL ribbons that are exactly 2 ¾ inches long.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Two of the five ribbons really are 2 ¾ in.; the rest are 2 ½, 2 ¼, and 3 in.  Because more than one option is right and because the set of correct ribbons changes each time the item is regenerated, neither a single-response MCQ nor a text-entry box can capture the task without losing information about the other ribbons the student also had to measure.

2.  Possible or Impossible? (medium)  
   A pencil is pictured on a ruler that begins at 0 but the pencil’s eraser starts at the ½-inch mark and its tip ends at 5 ¼ in.  
   Prompt: “Select ALL measurements that could correctly describe the length of the pencil.”  
   Options include 4 ¾ in., 4 3/4 in., 4 ¾ inches, 4.25 in., 5 ¼ in., 4 2/8 in., 4 ½ in.  
   Correct answers: 4 ¾ in.; 4 ¾ inches; 4 2/8 in.  
   Why multiselect is essential: The question assesses two ideas at once—measuring a length that does not begin at 0 AND recognizing fraction-decimal-equivalent or fraction-equivalent representations.  Students must mark every accurate statement while rejecting look-alikes, a requirement impossible with a single numeric entry or a one-correct MCQ.

3.  Build the Data Table (medium)  
   Four classroom objects (marker, glue stick, eraser, and craft stick) sit on a background ruler.  Below is a six-row table containing twelve clickable “tiles,” each tile showing an object name or a length such as “Marker—3 ½ in.”  
   Prompt: “Select ALL tiles that show a correct measurement to complete the class data table.”  
   Exactly four of the twelve tiles match the actual lengths; the rest are off by ¼ in. or ½ in.  
   Why multiselect is essential:  The standard requires generating measurement data.  The student must recognize every correct data-pair and leave out the wrong ones—mirroring real data collection from multiple objects.  A single response item could check only one object at a time, losing efficiency and the integrative reasoning that multiselect captures.

4.  Spot-the-Slip Measuring Audit (hard)  
   A peer “Jordan” has measured three screws and recorded: 1) 1 ½ in., 2) 2 ¼ in., 3) 3 in.  Screenshots of each screw on the ruler are shown.  
   Prompt: “Select ALL of Jordan’s measurements that are recorded accurately.”  
   In the images, only the second and third screws are correct; the first is actually 1 ¼ in.  
   Why multiselect is essential: The student is evaluating several independent measurements at once, just as in a lab journal check.  The multiselect format rewards partial knowledge (e.g., catching one of two errors), which neither a single text box nor a one-answer MCQ can do without multiple separate items.",#REF!

- Identify equivalent fractions by looking at their location on the number line

## Equivalent Fractions Have the Same Position

Equivalent fractions are fractions that show the same amount. They also represent the same location on the number line.

Let’s look at some fraction models.

<<Two horizontal number lines stacked vertically, both spanning from 0 to 1. The top number line is divided into 2 equal parts with 1/2 marked by a green dot. The bottom number line is divided into 4 equal parts with 2/4 marked by a green dot at the same relative position. Both dots align vertically to show they represent the same position. The style is clean and educational with bold black lines and clear labels.>>

We can see on the number line that 1/2 and 2/4 are equivalent fractions because they represent the same location on the number line.

If we look at more fraction models for thirds and sixths, we can see more equivalent fractions.

<<Visual without description>>

To check if two fractions are equivalent, find them on a number line. If they are in the same location, they represent the same amount and we call them **equivalent**.

### What Are Equivalent Fractions

Equivalent fractions are fractions that represent the same amount, even though they may look different. Think of equivalent fractions as different names for the same number.

**Quick Check:** Circle the word that means ""the same amount"": different, equivalent, bigger  
**Answer:** equivalent  
**Explanation:** Equivalent means equal or the same amount.

### Finding Fractions on Number Lines

A number line helps us see where fractions are located between 0 and 1. To find a fraction on a number line, count the equal parts and see which part the point lands on.

<<A horizontal number line from 0 to 1, divided into 4 equal parts with tick marks. The fraction 2/4 is marked with a red dot at the second tick mark. The number line has a clean, educational style with bold black lines and clear numerical labels. The background is white with the fraction 2/4 labeled above the red dot in blue text.>>

### Equivalent Fractions Have the Same Position

When two fractions are equivalent, they will be at the exact same distance from zero on their number lines. Even if the number lines are divided differently, equivalent fractions will always land at the same spot.

<<Two horizontal number lines stacked vertically, both spanning from 0 to 1. The top number line is divided into 2 equal parts with 1/2 marked by a green dot.

### Finding Equivalent Fractions on Two Number Lines

**Worked Example**

Look at these two number lines. Are 1/2 and 3/6 equivalent fractions?

<<Two horizontal number lines. Top line shows 0 to 1 divided into 2 equal parts with 1/2 marked by a blue dot at the halfway point. Bottom line shows 0 to 1 divided into 6 equal parts with 3/6 marked by a blue dot at the third tick mark. Both dots are vertically aligned at the same relative position.>>

**Step 1:** Locate the fraction point on the first number line.  
**Step 2:** Locate the fraction point on the second number line.  
**Step 3:** Compare the distances of both points from zero.  
**Step 4:** Decide whether the fractions are equivalent based on their positions.  

Solution:  
Step 1: The point for 1/2 is halfway between 0 and 1.  
Step 2: The point for 3/6 is at the third mark out of six equal parts, which is also halfway between 0 and 1.  
Step 3: Both points are the same distance from zero.  
Step 4: Since the points match, 1/2 and 3/6 are equivalent fractions.

# Graphing Fractions on Different Number Lines

Sometimes the number line is not split the same way as the fraction that you need to plot.

That’s okay! We can still graph it.

Let’s look at an example.

Let’s graph 4/8 on a number line that is split into fourths.

<<A number line labeled from 0 to 1 with four equal segments marked between them.>>

**Step 1:** Graph the fraction you are given on your own number line.

We want to graph 4/8.
- The denominator (8) tells us the whole is split into 8 equal parts.
- The numerator (4) tells us we count 4 parts from 0.

So 4/8 means 4 segments out of 8 equal segments between 0 and 1.

<<A number line from 0 to 1 divided into eight equal segments with a point marked at the fourth segment.>>

**Step 2:** Compare your number line to the one given.
The point that lines up to yours is the answer.

<<Two number lines from 0 to 1, with a black point at 4/8 on the top line connected by a red arrow to a red point at the corresponding position on the bottom line divided into fourths.>>

This tells us where the point 4/8 is on the graph broken up into fourths.

<<A number line from 0 to 1 divided into eight equal parts with a red dot marking the fraction 4/8.>>

Let’s see how it works for some other fractions.

**Example: Graph 2/3**

<<Number line from 0 to 2 with sixths and selected fraction labels>>

**Step 1:**
Graph 2/3 on the number line.

<<Number line with thirds, black dot at 2/3>>

**Step 2:**
Compare your number line with the number line divided by sixths.

<<Two aligned, to-scale number lines: thirds on top, sixths on bottom, with corresponding points and arrow>>

**Example: Graph 4/3**

<<Number line from 0 to 2 with sixths and selected fraction labels>>

**Step 1:**
Graph 4/3 on the number line.

<<Number line with thirds, black dot at 4/3>>

**Step 2:**
Compare your number line with the number line divided by sixths.

<<Two aligned, to-scale number lines: thirds on top, sixths on bottom, with dot at 4/3 and arrow>>

No matter what the fraction is, the process is always the same.

### Finding the Multiplication Factor
To match fractions on number lines with different parts, compare the denominators.
Ask: What can I multiply the denominator of 1/3 by to get 6 (the number of parts in 2/6)?
Since 3 × 2 = 6, the multiplication factor is 2.
This helps show that 1/3 = 2/6.


<<A colorful diagram showing two fraction strips stacked vertically. The top strip is divided into 3 equal parts with one part shaded blue, labeled ""1/3"". The bottom strip is divided into 6 equal parts with two parts shaded the same blue, labeled ""2/6"". Arrows connect the equivalent sections to show they represent the same amount. The strips should be rectangular, bright and clear with bold black dividing lines.>>

### Plotting Fractions on Number Lines
A number line can show fractions as points between whole numbers. The numerator is the number of spaces it takes to get to the plotted point. The denominator is the number of spaces between 0 and 1. 


<<A horizontal number line from 0 to 2, divided into eighths with clear tick marks. The number line should be drawn in black with evenly spaced marks. Key fractions like 1/4 (marked as 2/8) and 3/4 (marked as 6/8) are labeled below in blue text. A red dot shows the plotted point at 2/8. The background should be white with a clean, educational appearance.>>

### Working with Improper Fractions
Improper fractions have numerators that are larger than their denominators, making them greater than 1. These fractions are plotted beyond 1 on extended number lines. You still use the same process of creating equivalent fractions and counting spaces from zero.

**Quick Check:** Is 5/3 a proper fraction or an improper fraction? How do you know?
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see answer</strong></summary>
5/3 is an improper fraction because the numerator (5) is larger than the denominator (3), making it greater than 1.
</details>

## 3. WORKED EXAMPLES + GUIDED PRACTICE PROBLEMS

Use the examples on the left to help you solve the practice problems on the right. Then, check your work!

### Plotting Improper Fractions

**Worked Example**
Plot 5/3 on an extended number line partitioned into sixths.

<<An extended horizontal number line from 0 to 2, divided into sixths with clear tick marks. The line shows 0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 6/6=1, 7/6, 8/6, 9/6, 10/6, 11/6, 12/6=2. The whole numbers 0, 1, and 2 are clearly marked and slightly larger. The line should be black with evenly spaced marks.>>

**Step 1:** Look at the improper fraction and identify the numerator and denominator.
The fraction is 5/3, so the numerator is 5 and the denominator is 3.

**Step 2:** Count how many equal parts each whole number section of the extended number line is divided into.
Each whole number section is divided into 6 equal parts (sixths).

**Step 3:** Find what number to multiply the denominator by to get the number of parts in each whole section.
3 × 2 = 6, so I multiply by 2.

**Step 4:** Multiply both the numerator and denominator by that same number to make an equivalent fraction.
5/3 = (5 × 2)/(3 × 2) = 10/6

**Step 5:** Count from zero on the number line the number of spaces equal to your new numerator.
Count 10 spaces from zero.

**Step 6:** Place your point at that location on the number line.
The point goes at the 10/6 mark, which is between 1 and 2.

**Guided Practice**
Plot 7/4 on an extended number line partitioned into eighths.

<<An extended horizontal number line from 0 to 2, divided into eighths with clear tick marks.

","Task 1: Graphing a Fraction Less Than 1 (Example: 1/4 on a number line divided into twelfths)
The number line is split into twelfths. To show 1/4, let’s compare.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. From 0 to 1, there are 12 equal jumps. Each jump is one twelfth.
0, 1/12, 2/12, 3/12 … 12/12.

STEP 2: Draw another number line below it. This time, split it into 4 equal jumps. Each jump is one fourth.
0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1.

STEP 3: Match the points.
Notice that 1/4 is the same place as 3/12.
So we put the point on 3/12 in the twelfths line.

Task 2: Graphing a Fraction Greater Than 1 (Example: 5/3 on a number line divided into sixths)
The fraction is 5/3. That’s more than 1.

STEP 1: Look at the number line. Each whole is cut into 6 equal jumps. Each jump is one sixth.
0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6 … 6/6 (which is 1). Keep going: 7/6, 8/6 … up to 12/6 (which is 2).

STEP 2: Compare the fractions.
5/3 means 5 pieces when the whole is cut into 3 parts.
That’s the same as 10/6.

STEP 3: Find 10/6 on the sixths number line.
The point for 5/3 goes at 10/6—just past 1, but not all the way to 2.

Task 3: Graphing a Fraction Less Than 1 (Example: 1/3 on a number line divided into twelfths)
The number line is split into twelfths. We need to show 1/3.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. Each jump is one twelfth.
0, 1/12, 2/12, 3/12, 4/12 … 12/12.

STEP 2: Draw another line below it. Split it into 3 equal jumps. Each jump is one third.
0, 1/3, 2/3, 1.

STEP 3: Match the points.
1/3 lands in the same place as 4/12.
So we put the point on 4/12 in the twelfths line.

Task 4: Graphing a Fraction Greater Than 1 (Example: 5/3 on a number line divided into sixths, extended past 1)
The number line goes past 1 and is split into sixths. We need 5/3.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. Each jump is one sixth.
0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6 … 6/6 (that’s 1). Then keep counting: 7/6, 8/6, 9/6, 10/6, 11/6, 12/6 (that’s 2).

STEP 2: Compare.
5/3 is the same as 10/6.

STEP 3: Find 10/6.
Mark the point at 10/6. That shows where 5/3 belongs—one whole and 4 more sixths.","# Instructional Approach

## Step-by-Step Explanations

Task 1: Graphing a Fraction Less Than 1 (Example: 1/4 on a number line divided into twelfths)
The number line is split into twelfths. To show 1/4, let’s compare.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. From 0 to 1, there are 12 equal jumps. Each jump is one twelfth.
0, 1/12, 2/12, 3/12 … 12/12.

STEP 2: Draw another number line below it. This time, split it into 4 equal jumps. Each jump is one fourth.
0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1.

STEP 3: Match the points.
Notice that 1/4 is the same place as 3/12.
So we put the point on 3/12 in the twelfths line.

Task 2: Graphing a Fraction Greater Than 1 (Example: 5/3 on a number line divided into sixths)
The fraction is 5/3. That’s more than 1.

STEP 1: Look at the number line. Each whole is cut into 6 equal jumps. Each jump is one sixth.
0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6 … 6/6 (which is 1). Keep going: 7/6, 8/6 … up to 12/6 (which is 2).

STEP 2: Compare the fractions.
5/3 means 5 pieces when the whole is cut into 3 parts.
That’s the same as 10/6.

STEP 3: Find 10/6 on the sixths number line.
The point for 5/3 goes at 10/6—just past 1, but not all the way to 2.

Task 3: Graphing a Fraction Less Than 1 (Example: 1/3 on a number line divided into twelfths)
The number line is split into twelfths. We need to show 1/3.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. Each jump is one twelfth.
0, 1/12, 2/12, 3/12, 4/12 … 12/12.

STEP 2: Draw another line below it. Split it into 3 equal jumps. Each jump is one third.
0, 1/3, 2/3, 1.

STEP 3: Match the points.
1/3 lands in the same place as 4/12.
So we put the point on 4/12 in the twelfths line.

Task 4: Graphing a Fraction Greater Than 1 (Example: 5/3 on a number line divided into sixths, extended past 1)
The number line goes past 1 and is split into sixths. We need 5/3.

STEP 1: Look at the top number line. Each jump is one sixth.
0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6 … 6/6 (that’s 1). Then keep counting: 7/6, 8/6, 9/6, 10/6, 11/6, 12/6 (that’s 2).

STEP 2: Compare.
5/3 is the same as 10/6.

STEP 3: Find 10/6.
Mark the point at 10/6. That shows where 5/3 belongs—one whole and 4 more sixths.",,,,,,,#REF!

## Using the Number Line to Find Equivalent Fractions

## Why Use the Number Line?

Fractions are equivalent when they represent the same point on the number line.

When we don’t have a number line already drawn, we can **make our own.**

## Steps to Make Your Own Number Line

Suppose the problem asks:

Which fraction is equivalent to 3/4?
- a) 2/3
- b) 6/8
- c) 4/5
- d) 2/8

**Step 1:** Draw your own number line and plot your given point.
Mark 0 on the left and 1 on the right.
Divide the line into 4 equal parts.
Count to the third mark. That is 3/4.

<<Number line labeled 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and 1, with a red dot at 3/4>>

**Step 2:** Graph each answer choice.
- 2/3 → divide into 3 parts. 2/3 is not at the same point as 3/4.

<<Number line labeled 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, with a red dot at 2/3>>

- 6/8 → divide into 8 parts. 6/8 lines up with 3/4.

<<Number line labeled 0, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 1, with a red dot at 6/8>>

- 4/5 → divide into 5 parts. 4/5 is to the right of 3/4.

<<Number line labeled 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, with a red dot at 4/5>>

- 2/8 → divide into 8 parts. 2/8 is to the left of 3/4.

<<Number line labeled 0, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 1, with a red dot at 2/8>>

**Step 3:** Identify which answer choice is located at the same point on the number line as the given fraction.
Since 6/8 lines up with 3/4, we know that 3/4 = 6/8.

**Quick Check:** On a number line, 3/6 and 1/2 land on the same point. What does this mean about the two fractions?  
**Click to see answer:** The two fractions are equivalent

Question: Which of the following fractions is equivalent to 3/4? Select all that apply.
<<A table displays four fractions in a row: 6/8, 9/12, 12/16, and 8/9.>>

Options:
A. 6/8  
B. 9/12  
C. 12/16  
D. 8/9

Answer: A, B, C

Answer Explanation:
To find fractions that are equivalent to 3/4, you need to multiply both the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number) of 3/4 by the same whole number.  
- Multiply both by 2: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) and \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \). So, \( 6/8 \) is equivalent to \( 3/4 \).
- Multiply both by 3: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) and \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \). So, \( 9/12 \) is equivalent to \( 3/4 \).
- Multiply both by 4: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) and \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \). So, \( 12/16 \) is equivalent to \( 3/4 \).
- \( 8/9 \) is not equivalent to \( 3/4 \), because there is no whole number you can multiply both 3 and 4 by to get 8 and 9 at the same time.

Question: Which of the following is NOT an equivalent fraction to 2/5?
<<A list of fractions is shown: 4/10, 6/15, 8/20, 5/12.>>

Options:
A. 4/10  
B. 6/15  
C. 8/20  
D. 5/12

Answer: D

Answer Explanation:
To check if a fraction is equivalent to 2/5, multiply both the numerator and denominator of 2/5 by the same whole number:
- \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) and \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \), so \( 4/10 \) is equivalent.
- \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) and \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \), so \( 6/15 \) is equivalent.
- \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) and \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \), so \( 8/20 \) is equivalent.
- There is no single whole number you can multiply both 2 and 5 by to get 5 and 12 at the same time. So, \( 5/12 \) is not equivalent to \( 2/5 \).

Question: Simplify \( \frac{18}{24} \) to lowest terms.
<<A fraction shows 18 over 24.>>

Answer: 3/4

Answer Explanation:
To simplify a fraction to lowest terms, you look for the greatest common factor that can divide both the numerator and the denominator.  
- The largest number that can divide both 18 and 24 is 6.
- Divide the numerator by 6: \( 18 \div 6 = 3 \).
- Divide the denominator by 6: \( 24 \div 6 = 4 \).
- So, \( \frac{18}{24} \) is simplified to \( \frac{3}{4} \).","Worked Example #1

MCQ – assesses immediate recognition of equivalent fractions via numerical and visual choices; Fraction Model – engages students in visually representing and explaining fraction equivalence using shaded models; Drag and Drop – tests mastery through interactive matching of fractions to their equivalent forms; Multiselect – evaluates deeper understanding by having students select all fractions equivalent to a given fraction.","1. SNAP-ON STRIPS (easy)  
Learner sees one fixed fraction strip with, say, 3/4 shaded. Below are six loose fraction strips, each the same overall length but cut into different numbers of equal pieces and shaded to match its printed label (e.g., 6/8, 9/12, 4/5, 2/3, 7/8, 12/16). The student drags as many strips as they wish onto the target strip. Only those whose shaded parts align perfectly with the shaded part of the target strip will “stick.” The task is to leave every equivalent fraction stuck and keep every non-equivalent strip off the bar. Because the student must physically test alignment rather than choose from discrete options, the item cannot be recreated faithfully with MCQ or text entry.

2. BUILD-A-FRACTION TRAY (medium)  
A blank fraction template (□ / □) sits in the center with a prompt such as “Make a fraction equivalent to 3/5.” On the left is a tray of ten draggable digit tiles (2–9, each repeated) and a single “×” symbol already printed between the numerator and denominator boxes. The student drags one digit into the numerator box and one digit into the denominator box to build any correct equivalent fraction (e.g., 6/10, 9/15). Multiple correct answers are possible, so the flexibility of freely pairing numerator and denominator digits is essential; enumerating all legal pairs in an MCQ would be unwieldy and defeat the open-ended nature of the task.

3. DOUBLE-SIDED SCALE TILE (medium)  
A large 2/3 is shown with a small empty “factor slot” attached to its fraction bar. A tray offers tiles labeled ×2, ×3, ×4, ÷2, ÷3. Dragging a tile onto the slot automatically displays the factor next to BOTH the numerator and the denominator (e.g., 2 ×3 / 3 ×3 → 6/9). A target fraction (6/9) is shown at the right; only one factor tile will convert 2/3 into it. Because the tile physically attaches to both parts at once, the item spotlights the idea of applying the same operation to numerator and denominator—something not conveyed when a student simply clicks a radio button.

4. PIN-POINT ON A NUMBER LINE (hard)  
A number line from 0 to 1 is displayed with thin “snap points” for every twelfth. A marker showing 3/4 is already pinned at its correct location. In a tray are eight draggable fraction labels (e.g., 6/8, 9/12, 2/3, 4/6, 5/6, 1/2, 12/16, 15/20). The student drags each label onto the line; labels that land exactly on the 3/4 location will lock in place, others will bounce back. The student’s job is to pin all and only the fractions equivalent to 3/4. Requiring spatial placement to prove coincidence on the line gives a form of evidence of equivalence that cannot be matched by selecting text answers.","1. Select-All Fraction Radar (easy)  
Prompt: “2/3 is shown below. Select ALL fractions that are equivalent to 2/3 because the numerator and denominator were both multiplied by the same whole number.”  
Choice set (one screen): 3/4, 4/6, 5/8, 6/9, 8/12, 9/12, 10/15, 12/18.  
Correct answers: 4/6, 6/9, 8/12, 12/18.  
Why MS is irreplaceable: there are several correct answers and several distractors intentionally close in value (e.g., 9/12).  A single-answer MCQ would assess only one instance, and an open-response could be satisfied with just one fraction; multiselect obliges students to recognize the entire set, showing breadth of understanding.

2. Simplify-Pathway Picker (medium)  
Prompt: “18/24 can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number one or more times. Select ALL fractions that can appear somewhere along a correct simplification pathway that ends in simplest form.”  
Choice set: 9/12, 6/8, 3/4, 2/3, 12/16, 1/2, 15/20, 4/5.  
Correct answers: 9/12 → 6/8 → 3/4 (any of these could be part of a legal path).  
Why MS is irreplaceable: students must identify every legitimate “stop” generated by successive division and ignore nearly-equivalent impostors (12/16, 1/2, 2/3).  Neither a single MC option nor a single numerical entry can capture the required network of correct interim fractions.

3. Operation-and-Outcome Pair Check (medium)  
Prompt stem shows the starter fraction 5/10.  Each option is a complete “operation → outcome” pair.  
Example option list (students select all that are correct):  
A. Multiply numerator and denominator by 3 → 15/30  
B. Divide numerator and denominator by 5 → 1/2  
C. Multiply numerator by 2 and denominator by 3 → 10/30  
D. Divide numerator by 2 and denominator by 5 → 2.5/2  
E. Multiply numerator and denominator by 4 → 20/40  
Correct answers: A, B, E.  
Why MS is irreplaceable: every option simultaneously blends the arithmetic action and its result.  Students must judge both pieces, and several are correct.  Asking for “one correct pair” (MCQ) or “enter a single equivalent fraction” (text) would not require examining the validity of multiple distinct operations.

Display three fraction pairs:  
Pair 1: 3/4 and 9/12

Below is a single mixed list of explanation statements; students select all that are true.  
• “For Pair 1, both numbers were multiplied by 3.”  
• “For Pair 1, the denominator was multiplied by 4 while the numerator was multiplied by 3.”  
• “For Pair 2, both numbers were divided by 2.”  
• “For Pair 2, the numerator was halved but the denominator stayed the same.”  
• “For Pair 3, both numbers were multiplied by 2.”

## Fractions That Equal Whole Numbers

**Fractions and Wholes**  
A whole means “one complete thing.”

Examples:  
1 whole pizza  
1 full water bottle  
1 full candy bar

**Fractions That Equal 1 Whole**

Let's look at this fraction strip that represents one whole:

<<A single orange rectangle representing one whole, undivided.>>

We can break it up several ways but when the numerator and denominator are the same, the fraction always equals 1 whole.

<<A table showing three rows: 2/2, 5/5, and 8/8, each with a matching fraction model showing all parts shaded.>>

**Quick Check:** If a chocolate bar has 6 equal pieces and all 6 are eaten, what fraction of the bar was eaten?
**Click to see answer:** 6/6 of the bar was eaten. That is 1 whole bar.

## Fractions That Equal More Than 1 Whole

Sometimes fractions can show more than one whole.

Let's look at this fraction model:

<<Visual: A clear diagram showing 2 complete rectangles, each divided into 3 equal vertical strips, with all strips shaded in a warm yellow color. Below the rectangles, show the counting process with arrows pointing to each shaded part numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. At the bottom, display the fraction 6/3 in large, bold numbers with labels ""6 shaded parts"" pointing to the numerator and ""3 parts in one whole"" pointing to the denominator.>>

Notice that 6 equal parts of fraction models broken into 3 gives us 2 wholes.  
So we know that 6/3 = 2.

**Quick Check:** Look at a model with 2 circles, each divided into 4 equal parts, with all parts shaded. How many total shaded parts are there?
<<Improper Fraction 8/4 Shown By Two Whole Circles Divided Into Fourths.>>
**Click to see answer:** Circle 1 has 4 shaded parts. Circle 2 has 4 shaded parts. 4 + 4 = 8 shaded parts.

Here are some more examples of fractions that are equal to whole numbers.

## 2. LEARNING CONTENT

### Understanding Equal Parts and Wholes

A fraction shows parts of a whole. When shapes are divided into equal parts that are exactly the same size, we can count these parts to write fractions. The bottom number of a fraction, called the denominator, tells us how many equal parts make one whole shape.

<<Visual: A colorful illustration showing three different whole shapes side by side - a circle divided into 4 equal parts (quarters) in blue, a rectangle divided into 3 equal parts (thirds) in green, and a hexagon divided into 6 equal parts (sixths) in orange. Each shape should be clearly labeled underneath with ""4 equal parts,"" ""3 equal parts,"" and ""6 equal parts"" respectively. The parts should be outlined in black with light pastel fills.>>

### Counting Shaded Parts Across Multiple Shapes

When we have more than one whole shape in a model, we count all the shaded parts together. The top number of a fraction, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have in total. If we shade all the parts in multiple whole shapes, we get more parts than what makes just one whole.

**Quick Check:** Look at a model with 2 circles, each divided into 4 equal parts, with all parts shaded. How many total shaded parts would you count?  
**Answer:** 8 shaded parts (4 parts in the first circle + 4 parts in the second circle = 8 total shaded parts)

### Writing Improper Fractions from Models

An improper fraction has a numerator that is bigger than or equal to the denominator. When we count shaded parts across multiple whole shapes, we often get improper fractions. To write the fraction, we put the total number of shaded parts on top and the number of parts in one whole shape on the bottom.

<<Visual: A clear diagram showing 2 complete rectangles, each divided into 3 equal vertical strips, with all strips shaded in a warm yellow color. Below the rectangles, show the counting process with arrows pointing to each shaded part numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. At the bottom, display the fraction 6/3 in large, bold numbers with labels ""6 shaded parts"" pointing to the numerator and ""3 parts in one whole"" pointing to the denominator.>>

## Prerequisite Skills  
• Count, read, and write whole numbers to at least 10.  
• Understand that a fraction represents equal parts of one whole.  
• Partition a shape or a segment into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 equal parts and name one part (e.g., “one-fourth”).  
• Locate and label 0 and 1 on a number line and recognize that the interval between them represents one whole.  
• Compare lengths visually to decide if two segments are equal.  

## Microskills  
• Recognize that any set of n equal parts makes one whole (e.g., 4 fourths = 1).  
• Determine when a numerator and denominator are the same number.  
• State that any whole number n can be shown as n/1.  
• Convert between a whole number and its /1 fraction form (e.g., 5 ↔ 5/1).  
• Convert 1 to a same-number numerator/denominator fraction with denominators 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 (e.g., 6/6).  
• Interpret tick marks on a number line to identify the denominator being used.  
• Match a point at 1 (or 2, etc., if the line extends) with all fractions that land at the same point.  
• Use equal-partition area or bar models to verify fraction–whole equivalence.  
• Explain why two fractions are equal to the same whole using “same number of pieces makes one whole” reasoning.

## Step-by-Step Explanations  

Task: Express a whole number as a fraction with a denominator of 1.  
STEP 1: Write the whole number as the numerator.  
STEP 2: Write 1 as the denominator.  
Example: 7 becomes 7/1.  

Task: Identify fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers.  
STEP 1: Look at the denominator.  
STEP 2: If the denominator is 1, the fraction equals its numerator (e.g., 5/1 = 5).  
STEP 3: If the numerator and denominator are the same, the fraction equals 1 (e.g., 3/3 = 1).  
STEP 4: If neither condition is met, the fraction is not a whole number.  

Task: Match whole numbers and their equivalent fractional forms.  
STEP 1: For each fraction, decide whether the denominator is 1 or the numerator equals the denominator.  
STEP 2: Convert the fraction to its whole-number value using the rules above.  
STEP 3: Connect the fraction to the matching whole number.  

Task: Locate and match fractions on a number line that represent whole numbers.  
STEP 1: Count the equal spaces between 0 and 1; this tells the denominator.  
STEP 2: Find the tick mark whose numerator equals the denominator (for 1) or whose denominator is 1 for numbers > 1.  
STEP 3: Label that point with both the fraction and its whole-number value.",,"Question Type: multiselect  
Question: You see the following fractions: 7/1, 8/4, 12/1, 14/2, and 9/3. Which of these are equal to whole numbers, and what whole numbers do they represent? Select ALL the fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers, and choose what whole numbers they are equal to.  
<<No visual necessary>>  
Answer:  
- 7/1 = 7  
- 8/4 = 2  
- 12/1 = 12  
- 14/2 = 7  
- 9/3 = 3  

Answer Explanation:  
A fraction represents a whole number when it can be simplified so that only 1 is in the denominator. To do this, divide the numerator and denominator by the same number until you cannot divide them evenly anymore.

- 7/1 is already written with 1 as the denominator, so it equals the whole number 7.  
- 8/4: Divide both 8 and 4 by 4. \( 8 \div 4 = 2 \), \( 4 \div 4 = 1 \). So, 8/4 simplifies to 2/1, which is the whole number 2.  
- 12/1 has 1 as the denominator, so it is the whole number 12.  
- 14/2: Divide both 14 and 2 by 2. \( 14 \div 2 = 7 \), \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \). So, 14/2 simplifies to 7/1, which is the whole number 7.  
- 9/3: Divide both 9 and 3 by 3. \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \), \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \). So, 9/3 simplifies to 3/1, which is the whole number 3.

Question: Write 17 as a fraction.  
<<No visual necessary>>  
Answer: 17/1

Answer Explanation:  
Any whole number can be written as a fraction by putting the number over 1. This is because dividing a number by 1 does not change its value. So, 17 as a fraction is 17/1.

Question Type: MCQ  
Question: Which of the following fractions does NOT represent a whole number?  
<<No visual necessary>>  
Answer: 5/2

Answer Explanation:  
To decide if a fraction is equal to a whole number, divide the numerator by the denominator and see if the answer is a whole number (with no remainder):

- 10/1: \( 10 \div 1 = 10 \) (whole number)  
- 12/3: \( 12 \div 3 = 4 \) (whole number)  
- 5/2: \( 5 \div 2 = 2.5 \) (not a whole number)  
- 8/4: \( 8 \div 4 = 2 \) (whole number)  

Only 5/2 does not give a whole number.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 14/2","MCQ, Number Line, Drag and Drop","1. Fraction Labels on a Number-Line (medium)  
Task setup  
• A horizontal number line is shown from 0 to 4 with only the whole-number tick marks labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.  
• Below the line are six draggable “fraction cards”: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/5, 8/4.  
Interaction goal  
Students drag each fraction card to the tick mark that it exactly names. More than one card can be dropped on the same tick (e.g., 1/1 and 5/5 both go to the “1” tick).  
Why drag-and-drop is irreplaceable  
The item demands simultaneous placement of multiple objects on shared targets, something a single MCQ or separate text-entry boxes cannot capture without breaking the holistic idea of the number line and the equivalence relationships it displays.

2. Sort-to-Bins: “Equal to 1, 2, or 3?” (easy)  
Task setup  
• Three open “bins” are labeled 1, 2, and 3.  
• Nine draggable fraction tiles are displayed: 10/5, 6/3, 7/7, 2/1, 3/1, 12/6, 15/5, 9/3, 4/2.  
Interaction goal  
Students drag each fraction tile into the bin for the whole number it equals.  
Why drag-and-drop is irreplaceable  
The single screen requires nine classification decisions at once. An MCQ would need nine separate questions; a text entry would need nine blanks but would not visually emphasize grouping by equivalence.

3. Build-the-Fraction Strips (easy)  
Task setup  
• Four horizontal “fraction strip frames” are shown; each already has the denominator 1 printed.  
• To the left is a bank of numerator tiles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.  
Interaction goal  
Students drag each numerator tile onto a frame to create 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1 so that every given whole number is expressed as a fraction.  
Why drag-and-drop is irreplaceable  
All numerators come from a common bank of identical-sized tiles; the physical act of choosing and placing reinforces that only the numerator changes while the denominator stays 1. A fill-in blank loses this concrete, manipulative aspect and treats each fraction in isolation.

4. “Snap-Together” Equivalence Puzzle (hard)  
Task setup  
• Six “puzzle bases” display the whole numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each base has an empty slot shaped so only one matching puzzle piece will fit.  
• Twelve uniquely-shaped draggable pieces each show a fraction: 8/4, 12/4, 5/5, 3/1, 6/2, 9/3, 18/3, 4/1, 10/2, 12/6, 15/5, 6/1.  
Interaction goal  
Students drag each fraction piece onto the whole-number base it equals; only the correct equivalence physically “snaps” into place.  
Why drag-and-drop is irreplaceable  
The self-locking mechanic provides immediate tactile feedback about equivalence without revealing answers. Recreating this many-to-many matching with MCQs would explode into dozens of separate items and lose the spatial-reasoning component that helps cement the concept.","1. Fraction Filter  
   Difficulty: Easy  
   Task type: Identify fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers  
   Stimulus: A list of eight fractions: 9/3, 5/1, 6/4, 8/2, 11/11, 7/5, 4/4, 10/0  
   Prompt: “Select ALL the fractions that are equal to a whole number.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: More than one (but not all) choices are correct; the student must evaluate each item independently. A single-answer MCQ would reveal how many correct choices exist, and fill-in-the-blank would not allow simultaneous comparison across several examples. The open set of correct/incorrect possibilities makes multiselect uniquely suited.

2. Whole-Number Landing Spots  
   Difficulty: Easy  
   Task type: Locate and match fractions on a number line representing whole numbers  
   Stimulus: A number line from 0 to 4 with six labeled points: A (12/4), B (3/1), C (5/2), D (8/2), E (9/3), F (7/2)  
   Prompt: “Select ALL points that are located at a whole number.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Several points share the target attribute while others do not. Students must analyze each location on the same visual; MCQ would either cue the count or require six separate items, while text entry would forfeit the efficiency of checking multiple graphical options at once.

3. Picture-Perfect Wholes  
   Difficulty: Medium  
   Task type: Recognize fractions equivalent to whole numbers using area models  
   Stimulus: Six small pictures (circles or rectangles) partitioned into equal parts; some are fully shaded (e.g., 5/5, 7/7), some partly shaded (3/4, 6/8), and one shows six identical shapes grouped as “6/1.”  
   Prompt: “Select ALL pictures that show a fraction equal to 1 whole or to another whole number.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Students must apply conceptual understanding across several models simultaneously. A forced-choice MCQ cannot capture the variety of correct answers without hinting at the number; separate text entries for each picture would be cumbersome and defeat the comparative reasoning the task demands.

4. Build the Number 7  
   Difficulty: Hard  
   Task type: Express a whole number as a fraction with denominator 1 and recognize other equivalent fractions  
   Stimulus: Ten candidate fractions and mixed numbers: 7/1, 14/2, 21/3, 28/5, 7/7, 49/7, 6 ¹/₁, 35/5, 70/10, 63/9  
   Prompt: “Select ALL expressions that are exactly equal to 7.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Multiple valid representations (some with denominator 1, some with other denominators) are intermingled with near-misses. The item demands flexible verification of each option; no single text entry or single-answer MCQ can assess this breadth without giving away the solution set or multiplying the item count.",#REF!

# Writing Whole Numbers as Fractions

A whole number can be written as a fraction with a denominator (bottom number) of 1.

**Example:** The whole number 4 can be written as 4/1.

<<Four one wholes: four shaded circles with labels and the fraction 4 over 1.>>

This helps us connect whole numbers to fractions.

**Quick Check:** Write the whole number 7 as a fraction.
**Click to see answer:** 7/1  
**Explanation:** Place the whole number 7 on top and 1 on the bottom.

# Fractions Equal to 1

A fraction equals 1 when the numerator (top number) and denominator are the same.
This works because the whole is divided into equal parts and all parts are taken.

<<A colorful illustration showing three visual examples: 4/2 represented by 4 pizza slices grouped into 2 pairs equaling 2 whole pizzas, 6/3 shown as 6 apple pieces arranged in 3 groups of 2 equaling 3 whole apples, and 8/4 displayed as 8 star stickers organized into 4 groups of 2 equaling 4 whole groups. Each example uses bright, kid-friendly colors with the fraction written clearly below each visual representation.>>

## Creating Fractions Equal to One

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value. These models all show equivalent fractions.

<<A sequence of 5 shaded squares, each split into 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 equal parts showing 1; 2/2; 3/3; 4/4; 5/5, respectively. The model visually demonstrates that all are equal to 1 whole.>>

It doesn’t matter how many pieces one whole is broken up into, if you shade in all the pieces, you have shaded in 1 whole shape.

You can use this information to find missing parts of fractions equal to one whole.

In this problem, we need to find the missing numerator.

<<A model showing: 1 = ?/8, with a visual of a fraction bar or shape split into 8 equal parts, numerator unknown.>>

We know 1 is equal to one whole, which is 1/1. To get a denominator of 8, we need to multiply 1 by 8/8.

We multiply by 8/8 because that’s like cutting the whole into 8 smaller equal parts. Since 8/8 is the same as 1, multiplying doesn’t change the size of the whole—it just changes the way we write it.

<<A step-by-step visual showing the transformation: 1 = 1/1 = ?/8, with arrows labeled ×8 from numerator and denominator to new equivalent fraction.>>

Multiplying gives us

<<A step-by-step visual showing the transformation: 1 = 1/1 = 8/8, with arrows labeled ×8 from numerator and denominator to new equivalent fraction.>>

So the missing numerator was 8.

## Creating Fractions Equal to Numbers Greater than One

We can also create fractions equivalent to numbers greater than 1.

These models each show 3 wholes.

<<A sequence of visuals showing 3 whole shapes, 6/2 (three shapes split in half, all shaded), 9/3 (three shapes split in thirds, all shaded), and 12/4 (three shapes split in fourths, all shaded). All represent 3 as a fraction.>>

We can find missing numerators in fractions that equal whole numbers.

In this problem, we need to find the missing numerator.

<<A model showing: 3 = ?/4, with a visual of 3 wholes subdivided into fourths, numerator unknown.>>

We know that 3 is equal to 3 whole, or 3/1.

To get a denominator of 4 we need to multiply by 4/4 to cut the wholes into 4 smaller equal parts. And remember, since 4/4 is the same as 1, multiplying doesn’t change the size of the whole.

<<A step-by-step visual showing the transformation: 3 = 3/1 = ?/4, with arrows labeled ×4 from numerator and denominator to new equivalent fraction.>>

Multiplying gives us

<<A step-by-step visual showing the transformation: 3 = 3/1 = 12/4, with arrows labeled ×4 from numerator and denominator to new equivalent fraction.>>

So the missing number was 12.

## The Rule for Comparing Unit Fractions

When comparing unit fractions, the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction. This happens because fewer pieces means each piece is bigger.

<<A colorful illustration showing two identical circular pizzas side by side. The left pizza is divided into 2 equal slices with one slice highlighted in bright red, labeled ""1/2"". The right pizza is divided into 4 equal slices with one slice highlighted in bright blue, labeled ""1/4"". The red slice is visibly larger than the blue slice. Below the pizzas, text reads ""1/2 > 1/4"" in bold letters.>>

## Using Comparison Symbols

* > means ""greater than""
* < means ""less than""
* = means ""equal to""

The symbol always points to the smaller number. For example, in 3 < 5, the open side faces 5 and the point faces 3.

**Quick Check:** Which pieces are bigger: A whole cut into 3 equal parts or the same whole cut into 6 equal parts?
**Click to see answer:**
The pieces from 3 equal parts are bigger.
We are cutting the same whole.
When you cut something into more equal parts, each piece gets smaller.
Since 3 parts is fewer than 6 parts, each piece from 3 parts is bigger than each piece from 6 parts.

## Same Numerators

Remember, the numerator is the top number of a fraction.

Let’s look at two fractions with the same numerator:

<<Two circle fraction models, one showing one shaded part out of three and the other showing one shaded part out of four, illustrating the fractions one-third and one-fourth.>>

We see that the numerators are the same. They are both 1.

These fractions have different denominators because their bottom numbers are different.
The denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is split into.

When the denominator is larger, each part is smaller.
This means that if the numerator is the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator is going to be larger.

### Understanding Same Numerator Fractions

When fractions have the same numerator, they have the same top number. The numerator tells us how many parts we are talking about. For example, 2/3 and 2/8 both have the numerator 2, which means we are looking at 2 parts in each fraction.

**Quick Check:** Look at these fractions: 3/4, 3/6, 5/8, 3/2. Which fractions have the same numerator?  
**Answer:** 3/4, 3/6, and 3/2 all have the numerator 3.  
**Explanation:** These fractions all have 3 as the top number, which is the numerator.

### How Denominators Affect Fraction Size

The denominator is the bottom number that shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into. When the numerator stays the same, a larger denominator makes smaller pieces. Think about pizza slices: 1 slice from a pizza cut into 8 pieces is smaller than 1 slice from a pizza cut into 4 pieces.

<<Visual: Split-screen illustration showing two identical circular pizzas. Left pizza is divided into 4 equal slices with 1 slice highlighted in red. Right pizza is divided into 8 equal slices with 1 slice highlighted in red. The highlighted slice on the left is visibly larger than the highlighted slice on the right. Both pizzas are the same size and golden-brown color with pepperoni toppings. Clean, educational cartoon style with clear black dividing lines.>>

### Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerator

To compare fractions with the same numerator, look at the denominators. The fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction because its pieces are bigger. The fraction with the larger denominator is the smaller fraction because its pieces are smaller.

<<Visual: Horizontal comparison chart showing three fraction bars of equal length. Top bar shows 2/3 with 2 out of 3 sections shaded blue. Middle bar shows 2/4 with 2 out of 4 sections shaded blue. Bottom bar shows 2/6 with 2 out of 6 sections shaded blue. Each bar is divided into equal rectangles with clear black lines. The shaded portions get progressively smaller from top to bottom, demonstrating that 2/3 > 2/4 > 2/6. Clean, educational style with consistent blue shading.>>

### Using Inequality Symbols

The symbols <, >, and = help us compare fractions. The symbol < means ""less than,"" > means ""greater than,"" and = means ""equal to."" When comparing fractions with the same numerator, the fraction with the smaller denominator gets the > symbol, and the fraction with the larger denominator gets the < symbol.

**Quick Check:** If you see 4/6 and 4/8, which fraction should come first if you want to write ""fraction > fraction""?  
**Answer:** 4/6 > 4/8 because 6 is smaller than 8, making 4/6 the larger fraction.  
**Explanation:** When the numerators are the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator is greater.

### Understanding Fraction Parts

A fraction has two parts: the numerator on top and the denominator on the bottom. The numerator tells you how many parts you have. The denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole thing is divided into.

<<A colorful illustration showing a large fraction 3/4 with clear labels. The numerator ""3"" is highlighted in bright blue with an arrow pointing to it and the label ""Numerator - parts you have"" in kid-friendly font. The denominator ""4"" is highlighted in bright red with an arrow pointing to it and the label ""Denominator - total equal parts"" in matching font. The fraction bar is thick and black. The background is light yellow with a cheerful, educational style.>>

### The Rule for Comparing Fractions with Same Denominators

When two fractions have the same denominator, you only need to look at the numerators.

**Quick Check:** Which numerator is larger: 5 or 3?  
**Answer:** 5 is larger than 3.  
**Explanation:** When comparing whole numbers, 5 is greater than 3, so 5/8 would be greater than 3/8.

### Using Comparison Symbols

We use three symbols to compare fractions: > means ""greater than,"" < means ""less than,"" and = means ""equal to."" Remember that the symbol opens toward the bigger number, like a hungry mouth eating the larger number, and points at the smaller number.

<<A bright, engaging visual showing three comparison symbols in large, bold text. The "">"" symbol is colored green with a small cartoon mouth with teeth, pointing right toward a larger circle. The ""<"" symbol is colored blue with a cartoon mouth pointing left toward a larger circle. The ""="" symbol is colored purple with two identical circles on either side. Below each symbol are the words ""greater than,"" ""less than,"" and ""equal to"" in clear, readable font. The background is white with subtle decorative elements.>>

### Finding Multiple Fractions That Are Smaller or Larger

Sometimes you need to find several fractions that are smaller or larger than a given fraction. When all fractions have the same denominator, just look for numerators that are smaller or larger than the given fraction's numerator.

**Quick Check:** If you need to find fractions smaller than 4/6, what should you look for in the numerators?  
**Answer:** Look for numerators smaller than 4, such as 1, 2, or 3.  
**Explanation:** Since all fractions have the same denominator (6), any fraction with a numerator less than 4 will be smaller than 4/6.

• Identify and name basic unit fractions (½, ⅓, ¼, ⅙, ⅛).  
• Match a simple pictorial model (circle, bar, number line) to a written fraction.  
• Distinguish numerator (top number) from denominator (bottom number).  
• Understand that the symbols >, <, and = show comparisons for whole numbers.  
• Recognize that fractions must describe pieces of the same-sized whole to be compared fairly.  

## Microskills  
• Locate and circle the numerators; locate and circle the denominators.  
• Decide whether the two fractions share the same numerator or the same denominator.  
• Reason that “smaller pieces” come from larger denominators (1/8 < 1/4).  
• Reason that “more pieces” with the same size parts create a larger fraction (5/6 > 3/6).  
• Choose and place the correct comparison symbol (> , < , =) between two fractions.  
• Explain the comparison using words, pictures, or a number-line sketch.  
• Check that the fractions refer to the same whole before finalizing the comparison.  

## Precise Vocabulary  
Numerator – The number of equal parts being considered (top number).  
Denominator – The total number of equal parts in the whole (bottom number).  
Fraction – A number that names equal parts of a whole, written a⁄b.  
Whole – The single object, region, or set that is being split into equal parts.  
Compare – Decide if one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another.  
Greater than (>) – A symbol showing the first number is larger.  
Less than (<) – A symbol showing the first number is smaller.  
Equal to (=) – A symbol showing the two numbers have the same value.  
Unit fraction – A fraction with numerator 1; represents one part of the whole.

## Clock Hands Are Different

Every analog clock has two hands that are different sizes. The hour hand is short and thick. The minute hand is long and thin. These hands work together to show us the time.

<<A large, colorful analog clock face with clear numbers 1-12 around the edge. The clock shows 3:00 with a short, thick red arrow pointing directly at 3 (hour hand) and a long, thin blue arrow pointing directly at 12 (minute hand). The hands are clearly labeled with text boxes: ""Hour Hand - Short"" pointing to the red hand and ""Minute Hand - Long"" pointing to the blue hand. The clock face is white with black numbers and clear tick marks between each number.>>

## Reading Minutes by Counting by Fives

To read minutes, look at the long hand first. Start at 12 and count by fives around the clock. Each number on the clock represents 5 minutes. When you reach where the long hand points, you have found the minutes.

**Quick Check:** Count by fives starting from 12 and going around the clock. What number do you get when you reach the 6?  
**Click to see answer:** 30 minutes. You count: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

## Counting Individual Tick Marks

Sometimes the minute hand points between two numbers. When this happens, count by fives to the last number you passed, then count the individual tick marks one by one. Each tick mark equals one minute.

<<A close-up section of a clock face showing the area between 2 and 3, with five clear tick marks between these numbers. Each tick mark is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right. The section shows ""10 minutes"" labeled at the 2 and ""15 minutes"" labeled at the 3, with arrows pointing to each tick mark showing the individual minute counts: 11, 12, 13, 14. The background is light blue with dark blue markings.>>

## Hour Hand Position Changes

The hour hand moves slowly as time passes. It does not jump from number to number. Instead, it moves gradually between numbers. The hour is always the number the hour hand has already passed. You know it has passed a full hour if the minute hand has passed 12.

**Quick Check:** If the hour hand is halfway between 4 and 5, and the minute hand points to 6, what hour is it?  
**Click to see answer:** It is 4 o'clock hour because the minute hand has passed 12, so we use the number the hour hand has passed, which is 4.

Today, you will learn how to:
- Find how much time passes between a start time and an end time

## LEARNING CONTENT

### What Does Elapsed Time Mean?

**Elapsed time** is the amount of time that passes from a start to an end.  
It tells us “how long something takes.”

**Examples:**
- How long does recess last?
- How much time passes from breakfast to lunch?
- How long does it take to get to school?

### Elapsed Time on a Clock

A clock shows minutes and hours.  
We can move the hands to see time pass.

Let’s look at an example:

<<A table showing start time 7:15 and end time 8:00, with clock faces for each time.>>

Count how many minutes passed from the start time to the end time.

<<An analog clock showing how to count the minutes from 7:15 to 8:00.>>

**Quick Check:** If school starts at 8:30 and it’s 8:50 now, how many minutes have passed?

**Click to see answer:** 20 minutes have passed, because 50 - 30 = 20 minutes

### Elapsed Time on a Number Line

Sometimes it’s easier to show elapsed time by drawing jumps.

Let’s look at this problem:
- Start Time: 9:52 am
- End Time: 10:35 am
- Elapsed Time: ?

First let's use a number line to make a timeline.

<<An empty number line for showing elapsed time.>>

Now let’s see how many minutes it takes to get to the next hour.

<<A number line showing a jump from 9:52 to 10:00.>>

Now let’s see how many minutes it takes to get to the end time.

<<A number line showing a jump from 10:00 to 10:35.>>

Now we can add the minutes.

<<Elapsed time equation: 8 plus 35 equals 43 minutes, in big red letters.>>

## Prerequisite Skills  
• Read analog and digital clocks to the nearest minute.  
• Identify a.m. and p.m. correctly within the 12-hour cycle.  
• Count by 5s and 1s fluently to 60.  
• Add and subtract two-digit numbers within 100 without a calculator.  
• Understand that 60 minutes = 1 hour and apply regrouping across 60.  

## Microskills  
• Locate and record the start time (hour, minutes, a.m./p.m.).  
• Locate and record the end time (hour, minutes, a.m./p.m.).  
• Compare minute values and decide whether regrouping (borrowing 60 minutes) is needed.  
• Perform the “60-minute regroup” (add 60 to end minutes, subtract 1 from end hour).  
• Subtract minutes (0–59) accurately.  
• Subtract hours (0–11) accurately after any regrouping.  
• Express elapsed time in “___ hours ___ minutes” format.  
• Check that the solution is reasonable (elapsed minutes < 60 and hours not negative).  

## Precise Vocabulary  
Start time – the clock time when an event begins.  
End time – the clock time when an event ends.  
Elapsed time – the total amount of time that passes from the start time to the end time.  
Hour – a unit of time equal to 60 minutes.  
Minute – a unit of time; 60 minutes make 1 hour.  
a.m. – the 12-hour period from midnight to just before noon.  
p.m. – the 12-hour period from noon to just before midnight.  
Regroup (for time) – exchanging 1 hour for 60 minutes (or vice-versa) during subtraction.

### Finding Start and End Times in Word Problems

First, read the word problem. Then look for two important times. The **start time** tells you when something begins, and the **end time** tells you when it finishes. Both times must be in the same a.m. or p.m. period.

<<A colorful illustration showing two digital clocks side by side. The left clock displays ""2:15 PM"" with a green border and is labeled ""START TIME"" in bold green letters below. The right clock displays ""4:30 PM"" with a red border and is labeled ""END TIME"" in bold red letters below. Between the clocks is a curved arrow pointing from left to right with ""ELAPSED TIME"" written along the arrow in blue letters.>>

### Counting Time on a Number Line

You can use a **number line** to count **elapsed time** by making jumps. Start at your **start time**. Jump to the next whole hour. Then jump by full hours. Finally, jump the remaining minutes to reach your **end time**.

<<A horizontal number line diagram showing elapsed time calculation. The line shows times from 2:15 PM to 4:30 PM with three distinct colored jumps: a blue curved arrow from 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM labeled ""45 minutes"", a green curved arrow from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM labeled ""1 hour"", and an orange curved arrow from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM labeled ""30 minutes"". Below the number line, the calculation ""45 minutes + 1 hour + 30 minutes = 2 hours 15 minutes"" is shown in black text.>>

### Finding End Time on a Number Line

We can find the **end time** for an elapsed time problem using a number line.

Let's look at this problem:
Start Time: 2:45 pm  
Elapsed Time: 1 hour 30 minutes  
End Time: ?

First, let's use a number line and write down our start time.

<<A horizontal number line with thick black endpoints on both sides, designed for illustrating time intervals or elapsed time.>>

Now let’s use the elapsed time to gradually make jumps on the number line until we have gone 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Let’s start with 1 hour. That brings us to 3:45 pm.

<<A number line showing a red arrow labeled '1 hour' jumping from 2:45 pm to 3:45 pm, with both times marked on the line.>>

Now let’s go 15 more minutes to get to 4:00 pm.

<<A number line showing elapsed time from 2:30 pm to 4:00 pm with labeled jumps of 1 hour and 15 minutes.>>

Now we just need 15 more minutes for us to have gone 1 hour and 30 minutes.

<<A number line diagram showing time increments from 3:45 pm to 4:15 pm with labeled jumps of 1 hour and two 15-minute intervals.>>

This takes us to 4:15 pm.

## A.M. and P.M.

A day has 24 hours, but a clock only shows 12 before it starts over. So each time on the clock happens twice a day.

We use **a.m.** and **p.m.** to tell the difference. **A.M.** starts at 12 midnight and lasts until 11:59 in the morning. **P.M.** starts at 12 noon and lasts until 11:59 at night.

**Click to see answer:**
School ends in the afternoon, so this is p.m.

## Time Word Problems

There are a few different types of time word problems:
1. You know when something started and how long it lasted. You are looking for the end time.
2. You know when something ended and how long it lasted. You are looking for the start time.
3. You know the start time and end time. You are looking for the elapsed time.

A number line can help you solve these problems.

Draw a line and mark the times you know.

<<A number line diagram showing labeled start time, end time, and elapsed time with arrows and blank spaces for entering values.>>

* If you know the start time, write it at the left end.
* If you know the end time, write it at the right end.
* Use jumps on the number line to show the time that passes.

Here are some examples:

### Example 1
A movie starts at 2:00 p.m. and ends at 3:30 p.m. How long was the movie?

If you know the start time and the end time, use time jumps to find how much time has passed.

<<A timeline diagram showing a movie starting at 2:00 p.m., jumping 2 hours to 3:00 p.m., then 30 minutes to 3:30 p.m., illustrating elapsed time calculation.>>

The movie was 2 hours and 30 minutes.

### Example 2
Michael’s piano lesson started at 10:15 a.m. and lasted 45 minutes. What time did his piano lesson end?

If you know the start time and elapsed time, add the time jumps to find the end time.

<<A timeline diagram showing time jumps of 35 minutes and 10 minutes from a starting point at 10:15 a.m. to find the ending time, with 11:00 a.m. marked as an intermediate point.>>

Michael’s piano lesson ended at 11:10 a.m.

### Example 3
Kyra needs to leave for the airport at 4:30 p.m. It takes her 1 hour 15 minutes to get ready. What time should she start getting ready?

If you know the end time and elapsed time, count backward to find the start time.

<<A timeline diagram showing how to count backward 1 hour and 15 minutes from 4:30 pm to find the starting time, with labeled arrows and time intervals.>>

Kyra should start getting ready at 3:15 p.m.

### Finding Start Time

**Worked Example:**
A school assembly ended at 11:30 a.m.
The assembly lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes.
What time did the assembly start? Include a.m. or p.m. in your answer.

**Step 1:** Identify what information you know and what you are looking for.
We know:
- The end time is 11:30 a.m.
- The elapsed time is 1 hour and 15 minutes.
- We are looking for the start time.

**Step 2:** Start at the end time and work backwards.
Start at 11:30 a.m.:
11:30 a.m. − 1 hour = 10:30 a.m.
10:30 a.m. − 15 minutes = 10:15 a.m.

**Step 3:** Write the time.
10:15 a.m.

**Guided Practice:**
A birthday party ended at 3:45 p.m.
The party lasted 2 hours and 30 minutes.
What time did the party start? Include a.m. or p.m. in your answer.

**Step 1:** Identify what information you know and what you are looking for.
**Click to see answer:**
We know:
- The end time is 3:45 p.m.
- The elapsed time is 2 hours and 30 minutes.
- We are looking for the start time.

**Step 2:** Start at the end time and work backwards.
**Click to see answer:**
Start at 3:45 p.m.:
3:45 p.m. − 2 hours = 1:45 p.m.
1:45 p.m. − 30 minutes = 1:15 p.m.

**Step 3:** Write the time.
**Click to see answer:**
1:15 p.m.",,,,,"Task 1: Solve a word problem to find elapsed time
(You know the start time and end time, but need to find how long something lasted.)

Steps

Figure out what the problem is asking—do you need the elapsed time, the start time, or the end time?

Write down the start time and the end time.

Count the minutes from the start time up to the next full hour (if needed).

Count the number of full hours between the times.

Count the remaining minutes from the last full hour to the end time.

Add up all the minutes and hours to get the total elapsed time.

Example
A movie started at 6:25 p.m. and ended at 8:10 p.m. How long did it last?

Step 1: The question says “How long did it last?” → elapsed time.

Step 2: Start = 6:25 p.m., End = 8:10 p.m.

Step 3: 6:25 → 7:00 = 35 minutes

Step 4: 7:00 → 8:00 = 1 hour

Step 5: 8:00 → 8:10 = 10 minutes

Step 6: 1 hour + (35 + 10 minutes) = 1 hour 45 minutes

Answer: The movie lasted 1 hour 45 minutes.

Task 2: Solve a word problem to find start time
(You know the end time and the elapsed time, but need to find when something began.)

Steps

Figure out what the problem is asking—do you need the elapsed time, the start time, or the end time?

Write down the end time and the total elapsed time.

Subtract the hours of the elapsed time from the end time.

Subtract the remaining minutes.

If subtracting minutes crosses back into the previous hour, regroup (borrow 1 hour = 60 minutes) and then subtract.

The result is the starting time. Don’t forget to label A.M. or P.M.

Example
A concert ended at 9:20 p.m. It lasted 2 hours 15 minutes. When did it start?

Step 1: The question says “When did it start?” → start time.

Step 2: End = 9:20 p.m., Elapsed = 2 hr 15 min.

Step 3: 9:20 − 2 hr = 7:20 p.m.

Step 4: 7:20 − 15 min = 7:05 p.m.

Step 5: No regrouping needed (20 ≥ 15).

Step 6: Start = 7:05 p.m.

Answer: The concert started at 7:05 p.m.

Task 3: Solve a word problem to find end time
(You know the start time and the elapsed time, but need to find when something finished.)

Steps

Figure out what the problem is asking—do you need the elapsed time, the start time, or the end time?

Write down the start time and the total elapsed time.

Add the hours of the elapsed time to the start time.

Add the remaining minutes.

If adding minutes goes past :60, regroup (add 1 hour and subtract 60 minutes).

The result is the ending time. Don’t forget to label A.M. or P.M.

Example
Soccer practice began at 4:35 p.m. It lasted 1 hour 50 minutes. When did it end?

Step 1: The question says “When did it end?” → end time.

Step 2: Start = 4:35 p.m., Elapsed = 1 hr 50 min.

Step 3: 4:35 + 1 hr = 5:35 p.m.

Step 4: 5:35 + 50 min = 6:25 p.m.

Step 5: Check regrouping: 35 + 50 = 85 → trade 60 min for +1 hr and 25 min → still 6:25.

Step 6: End = 6:25 p.m.

## LEARNING CONTENT

### Two-Step Word Problems with Time

Some word problems take **two steps**. In these problems, the time changes in two parts. First, find what the question is asking in order to figure out how to solve it.

### Finding End Time

If you are looking for the end time:
* Start at the start time.
* Add part 1.
* Add part 2.

**Example:**

Sam arrived at the library at 11:15 a.m. He read for 45 minutes and then picked out books for 45 minutes. What time did he leave?

First, start at the starting time, 11:15 a.m. and find where part 1 (reading for 45 minutes) ended on the number line.

<<A number line showing time from 11:15 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. with a red arrow labeled 'Part 1: 45 minutes' indicating the passage of time.>>

Next, find where part 2 (picking out books for 45 minutes) ended.

<<A timeline diagram showing two consecutive 45-minute intervals labeled as Part 1 and Part 2, with a midpoint marked at 12:00 pm and an unknown end time indicated by a question mark.>>

Sam left the library at **12:45 p.m.**

### Finding Start Time

If you are looking for the start time:
* Start at the end time.
* Subtract part 2 (go back).
* Subtract part 1 (go back).

**Example:**

During art class, Ava painted for 20 minutes and did pottery for 25 minutes. Her class ended at 3:35 p.m. What time did art class start?

First, start at the end time, 3:35 p.m. and go backwards to find where part 2 (25 minutes of pottery) started.

<<A timeline diagram showing a backward calculation from 3:35 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. by subtracting 25 minutes, illustrating elapsed time in two parts.>>

Next, go backwards again to find where part 1 (20 minutes of painting) started.

<<A timeline diagram showing two segments labeled 'Part 1: 20 minutes' and 'Part 2: 25 minutes' with a marked point at 3:10 p.m. and a question mark at the start.>>

Ava’s art class started at **2:50 p.m.**

- Choose the right unit, liters or milliliters, to measure how much liquid different containers can hold.

## What is Volume?

Volume is the amount of space a liquid takes up.
When we measure volume, we need to pick the right unit.
The unit tells how much liquid we have.

## Understanding Liters and Milliliters

There are two main units we use to measure liquid volume: liters and milliliters.
A liter is a bigger unit, like the amount in a large water bottle.
A milliliter is much smaller. It is about the size of 20 drops of water.

<<A colorful illustration showing two containers side by side: on the left, a large clear water bottle labeled ""1 Liter (L)"" filled with blue water, and on the right, a small eyedropper with a single drop falling from it labeled ""1 Milliliter (mL)"". The background is light blue with simple, child-friendly cartoon styling.>>

## Choosing the Right Unit

If a container holds as much as a large water bottle, use liters.
If a container holds only a few drops, use milliliters.

**Quick Check:** If you want to measure the liquid in a swimming pool, would you use liters or milliliters?  
**Click to see answer:** Liters.

## Use the examples on the left to help you solve the practice problems on the right. Then, check your work!

### Using the right units

**Worked Example**

Which is the better estimate for the volume of a teaspoon: 5 milliliters or 5 liters?

**Step 1:** Picture the amount. How much could the object hold?
A teaspoon is a small spoon used for stirring drinks or taking medicine.

**Step 2:** If the amount is small, like a dropper, choose milliliters. If the amount is larger, like a large bottle of water, choose liters.
A teaspoon holds about the same as 5 drops from an eyedropper.
5 milliliters

**Guided Practice**

Which is the better estimate for the volume of a juice box: 250 milliliters or 250 liters?

**Step 1:** Picture the amount. How much could the object hold?
**Click to see answer:** A juice box is a small rectangular container that kids drink from at lunch.

**Step 2:** If the amount is small, like a dropper, choose milliliters. If the amount is larger, like a large bottle of water, choose liters.
**Click to see answer:** A juice box holds much more than drops from an eyedropper, but less than a large water bottle.
250 milliliters
",N/A,Ready,PASS,,"Task: Select the appropriate unit to record an object's volume based on its size.  
STEP 1: Picture the object filled with liquid.  
STEP 2: Compare that amount to a dropper (about 1 milliliter) and a large water bottle (about 1 liter).  
STEP 3: If the liquid seems closer to a dropper or only a few drops, choose milliliters.  
STEP 4: If the liquid seems closer to a water bottle or more, choose liters.","Instructional Approach  

## Prerequisite skills  
• Recognize that different attributes (length, mass, volume) require different units.  
• Read and write whole numbers and simple fractions.  
• Interpret number-line and scale markings.  
• Compare and order numbers and fractions (<, >, =).  
• Visualize everyday benchmark amounts of liquid (a dropper, a bottle of water, a sinkful).  

## Microskills  
• Distinguish volume from length and mass.  
• Recall and use the fact that 1 liter (L) = 1,000 milliliters (mL).  
• Match familiar objects to reasonable benchmark volumes (e.g., eyedropper ≈ 1 mL, juice box ≈ 250 mL, milk jug ≈ 2 L).  
• Decide whether liters or milliliters is the more appropriate unit for a given object or situation.  
• Read exact liquid levels that fall on labeled tick marks (whole, ½, or ¼ liters).  
• Estimate liquid levels that fall between tick marks to the nearest ¼-liter.  
• Record answers with the correct unit symbol (L or mL).  
• Explain or justify a unit choice in words, numbers, or pictures.  

## Precise Vocabulary  
Volume – the amount of space a liquid occupies.  
Capacity – the greatest volume a container can hold.  
Liter (L) – a metric unit of liquid volume; about the size of a large water bottle; 1,000 mL.  
Milliliter (mL) – a metric unit of liquid volume; about one eyedropper-full; 1,000 mL = 1 L.  
Unit – a standard quantity used in measurement.  
Estimate – a close, careful guess of a quantity.  
Tick mark – a small line on a scale that shows a labeled value.  
Graduated (container) – a vessel with marked intervals for measuring liquid.  
Scale – the numbered markings on a measuring tool.

Question: Which jug contains exactly 3 liters of water? <<Visual: Four different pictures of clear measuring jugs A, B, C, and D, each filled to a different level. The jugs are all marked with whole-liter increments (0 L, 1 L, 2 L, … 5 L). Jug A shows a liquid up to the 3 L mark, Jug B at 1 L, Jug C at 4 L, and Jug D at 2 L.>>  
Answer: Jug A  
Answer Explanation:  
- First, look at the markings on each jug to see how much liquid is inside.  
- Jug A’s liquid level is at the 3-liter mark.  
- The question asks for a jug with exactly 3 liters, so we need to match the liquid’s upper surface to the 3 L line.  
- Because Jug A’s liquid lines up with the 3 L marking, Jug A contains exactly 3 liters of water.  
- The other jugs have different amounts, as shown by their lines.

Question: Estimate the liquid volume in this container, expressing your answer as the nearest whole liter. <<Visual: A transparent cylindrical container with three horizontal marks labeled 0 L at the base, 1 L in the middle, and 2 L near the top. The water level is a little over halfway between the 1 L and 2 L marks.>>  
Answer: 2 liters  
Answer Explanation:  
- Look carefully at the marks for 1 L and 2 L on the container.  
- The liquid level is slightly above halfway between these two marks.  
- When estimating to the nearest whole liter, decide which mark the water is closer to.  
- Since the liquid is closer to the 2-liter mark than the 1-liter mark, we round up to 2 liters.  
- We estimate to the nearest whole number because there are no marks for fractions of a liter.","Worked Example #1  
Question: Lisa has a jug of juice. She pours the juice into a measuring cup and sees the level at the 1-liter mark. How many liters of juice does Lisa have?  
STEP 1: Read the measuring cup to find the mark where the liquid stops.  
 You read the cup and see the liquid stops at the 1-liter mark.  
STEP 2: Identify the value shown at that mark.

Answer: The bathtub holds more","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Fill-the-Pitcher (easy)  
What the student sees: A drawing of an empty 5-liter pitcher with a bold fill line drawn at 4 L. On the left are six identical “1 L water jug” icons that can be dragged into the pitcher. Each time a jug is dropped, a 1-liter “layer” of water appears in the pitcher; the icon disappears. The student stops dragging when the water reaches the fill line.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: The student is actively constructing a 4-liter measure, deciding when to stop. A single-choice or text-entry item would ask only for a number, not for the procedural act of measuring by repeated 1-liter units.

2. Sort-the-Containers (medium)  
What the student sees: Six photographs of everyday bottles (juice carton, soap bottle, etc.) partially filled, with faint liter markings visible. Three drop zones are labeled “About 1 L,” “About 2 L,” and “About 3 L.” Students drag each photo into the zone that best estimates its volume.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: The task requires simultaneous comparison and categorization of several objects. A series of multiple-choice questions would break the holistic estimation process and cue the answer; drag-and-drop makes students show their own groupings in one screen.

3. Place-on-the-Number-Line (medium)  
What the student sees: A horizontal number line marked 0 L, 1 L, 2 L, 3 L. Four container images (e.g., beaker, saucepan, vase, jar) appear above, each with a visible water level. Students drag each container onto the spot on the number line that represents its volume to the nearest half-liter. The drop zone accepts any point, not only fixed slots.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: Positioning on a continuous line cannot be mimicked with discrete options or a single numeric entry; it requires spatial judgment of “about where” the volume lies.

4. Mix-and-Measure Recipe (hard)  
What the student sees: A recipe card that says “Make 3 L of fruit punch.” On the left: unlimited 1 L pitchers and unlimited 0.5 L cups. Students drag the measuring vessels into a large punch bowl illustration; each drop instantly shows accumulating liquid. They may use any combination (e.g., 2 × 1 L + 2 × 0.5 L, or 3 × 1 L). They must stop at exactly 3 L.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: There are many valid ways to compose 3 L, and the student demonstrates both measuring and composing volume. Enumerating every possible combination as answer choices is impractical; drag-and-drop lets students choose and build the measure themselves.","Multiselect Ideas  

1. “About-a-Liter Objects” [easy]  
Task. Show 8 clear photos of everyday containers (e.g., juice box 250 mL, 1-L milk carton, 1-L sports bottle, 2-L soda bottle, 5-L paint pail, soup can 400 mL, bathtub, 1-L measuring jug). Prompt:  
“Select ALL the containers that would hold about 1 liter when they are full.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable. • Estimation is being assessed across several contexts at once; there are 3 correct answers. • A single-answer item (MCQ) or numeric entry cannot reveal whether a student can consistently identify every acceptable 1-L object while rejecting the others.  

2. “Read the Jug Scale” [medium]  
Task. Six photographs of clear jugs (0–5 L scale) appear side-by-side. Each is filled to a different graduation. Prompt:  
“Select ALL jugs that contain more than 2 liters but less than 4 liters of liquid.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable. • Students must interpret the scale on every image, not just one. • It checks repeated, accurate measurement reading and comparison, which a one-choice MCQ cannot capture without forcing multiple separate items.  

3. “Check the Lab Notes” [medium]  
Task. Four rows are shown. Each row has (a) a photo of a beaker or pitcher with a liter scale, and (b) a student’s recorded measurement in liters (e.g., “3 L”). Prompt:  
“Some of the recorded measurements are correct, and some are not. Select ALL rows whose record matches the photo.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable. • The item simultaneously probes measurement reading and error detection over several cases, requiring students to affirm all correct records and reject the incorrect ones in one go. • A single-answer item cannot evaluate this “all-that-apply” reasoning.  

4. “True Statements About a Pitcher” [hard]  
Task. One large image shows a pitcher filled to the 4-L mark. Six textual statements appear:  
A. “It would take four 1-L bottles to empty this pitcher.”  
B. “It holds enough to fill eight 500 mL cups.”  
C. “It contains less than 3 L.”  
D. “You could pour two 2-L jugs from it with some left over.”  
E. “It has exactly twice as much as a 2-L soda bottle.”  
F. “It has the same amount as two 1-L bottles.”  
Prompt: “Select ALL statements that are reasonable based on the picture.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable. • Students must judge several different estimation and comparison claims (equal, greater, multiple, half) against the same observed 4 L volume. • Only a multiselect format lets them weigh each independent statement in a single cohesive task, something neither MCQ (one answer) nor text entry (one response) can do.",#REF!

## What is Mass?

Mass is similar to weight.  
If something has more mass, it feels heavier when we pick it up.  
If something has less mass, it feels lighter.  
We measure mass in **grams** and **kilograms**.

## Understanding Grams

**Grams** are used to measure light objects.  
The symbol for grams is **g**.  
A paper clip weighs about 1 gram.  
Coins, pencils, and a slice of bread are also measured in grams.

<<A colorful illustration showing a digital scale with a paper clip on it, displaying ""1 g"" on the screen. The scale should be white with a clear digital display in black numbers. Around the scale, show other light objects like a coin, pencil, and slice of bread with labels showing their approximate masses in grams (coin: 5 g, pencil: 10 g, bread slice: 25 g). Use a bright, clean cartoon style with soft lighting.>>

## Understanding Kilograms

**Kilograms** are used to measure heavy objects.  
The symbol for kilograms is **kg**.  
A hardcover book weighs about 1 kilogram.  
Other heavy objects like backpacks, pets, or chairs are also measured in kilograms.

<<A colorful illustration showing a balance scale with a textbook on one side displaying ""1 kg"" on a digital readout. Around the scale, show other heavy objects like a backpack, small dog, and chair with labels showing their approximate masses in kilograms (backpack: 3 kg, small dog: 8 kg, chair: 5 kg). Use the same bright, clean cartoon style with consistent colors from the previous visual.>>

",N/A,Ready,PASS,,"Task: Select the appropriate unit (grams or kilograms) to record an object's mass based on its size.  
STEP 1: Think about how heavy the object is in real life.  
STEP 2: Compare that heaviness to about 1 kilogram—the mass of a small book.  
STEP 3: If the object feels lighter than 1 kilogram, choose grams (g).  
STEP 4: If the object feels 1 kilogram or heavier, choose kilograms (kg).","Instructional Approach  
This lesson follows a concrete-to-representational-to-abstract (CRA) path. Students first handle real classroom objects and place them on a balance labeled in grams or kilograms (concrete). Next they observe teacher-made photo cards of objects next to scales (representational). Finally, they make quick mental estimates with no visuals (abstract). Throughout, a simple benchmark strategy—“A hardcover book is about 1 kilogram”—anchors their thinking. Frequent turn-and-talks and mini-whiteboard checks keep engagement high while giving the teacher instant feedback for reteaching or extension.

## Prerequisite skills
• Read whole numbers to 1,000.  
• Compare whole numbers using greater than / less than.  
• Understand that a “unit” is a fixed amount used for measuring.  
• Recognize and read simple scale markings by 1s, 5s, and 10s.  
• Use basic comparative vocabulary (lighter, heavier, about the same).

## Microskills
• Identify common classroom objects that are lighter than 1 kg.  
• Identify common objects that are about or heavier than 1 kg.  
• Recall the benchmark reference: 1 hardcover book ≈ 1 kg.  
• Decide whether an item is “much lighter,” “about the same,” or “much heavier” than the benchmark.  
• Map “much lighter” → grams (g); “about the same or heavier” → kilograms (kg).  
• State the chosen unit aloud and justify with a one-sentence reason.  
• Transfer the decision to paper by circling or typing g or kg in a prompt.

## Precise Vocabulary
mass – the amount of matter in an object; how heavy something is  
gram (g) – a small unit of mass; about the weight of a paper clip  
kilogram (kg) – a larger unit of mass equal to 1,000 grams; about the weight of a hardcover book

Task: Select the appropriate unit (grams or kilograms) to record an object's mass based on its size.

STEP 1: Think about how heavy the object is in real life.  
STEP 2: Compare that heaviness to about 1 kilogram—the mass of a small hardcover book.  
STEP 3: If the object feels lighter than 1 kilogram, choose grams (g).  
STEP 4: If the object feels 1 kilogram or heavier, choose kilograms (kg).",,"Question Type: text_entry
Question: Which of the following is the mass of the apples? <<alt: Image of a bench scale with a bag of apples placed on it. The pointer is at 4 kg.>>  
Answer: 4 kilograms  
Answer Explanation:  
- To find the mass, look at where the pointer is on the scale.  
- The pointer is at 4, and the unit shown on the scale is ""kg,"" which stands for kilograms.  
- This means the apples have a mass of 4 kilograms.  
- Measuring in grams would be for much smaller objects. For example, 4 grams or 400 grams would be much too light for a bag of apples, and 40 kilograms would be much too heavy.  
- Always match the number and the unit shown on the scale to find the correct mass.

Question: What is the mass in grams of the bananas shown on the scale? <<alt: Image of a kitchen scale with three bananas on its tray. The needle points to '350', and the dial is marked in grams.>>  
Answer: 350 grams  
Answer Explanation:  
- First, check the unit marked on the scale. In this case, it is grams, written as ""g.""  
- The needle is pointing to 350, so the mass is 350 grams.  
- 35 grams would be too little for three bananas, and 3,500 grams or 3 kilograms would be much heavier than three bananas usually are.  
- Always read both the number and the unit to find the correct measurement.

Question Type: MCQ  
Question: You need to record the mass of a medium-sized textbook. Which unit is more appropriate to use: grams or kilograms?  
Answer: Kilograms  
Answer Explanation:  
- Textbooks are heavier than small objects like pencils or erasers.  
- Grams are better for measuring light objects because you would get a very large number of grams for something heavier.  
- Kilograms are used for heavier items, and most textbooks have a mass of about 1 kilogram or more.  
- Using kilograms makes it easier to read and understand the measurement when you measure something heavier like a textbook.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 650 grams","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Gram or Kilogram Sorting Wall ‑ Easy  
What the student sees  
• 10 picture-cards of everyday items (paperclip, soccer ball, textbook, watermelon, feather, house cat, etc.).  
• Two open “shelves” labeled “Measure in grams” and “Measure in kilograms.”  

Interaction  
The ONLY action is to drag each picture-card onto one of the two shelves.  

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must make a separate decision for every object and visibly build two collections. A single MCQ or text entry can capture only one decision at a time; here the simultaneous multi-classification and the visual result (an obviously lopsided shelf if errors occur) give immediate evidence of understanding that cannot be duplicated by any single-response format.

Skill focus  
Select the appropriate unit (g vs kg) for different-sized objects.



2. Set the Dial ‑ Medium  
What the student sees  
• A large, blank kitchen-scale dial marked in 50-g intervals from 0 g to 1 kg.  
• The pointer is detached and sitting to the side.  
• Above the scale is a picture of an orange with text “Mass of the orange = 160 g.”  

Interaction  
The student drags the pointer onto the dial and rotates/places it so its tip points exactly to the 160 g mark.

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The required action is spatial positioning on a continuous scale. Typing “160 g” or choosing it from a list tests reading but not interpreting and marking a scale. The drag action shows the student can locate the value on an unfamiliar interval layout—something other item types cannot probe.

Skill focus  
Identify the correct mass value of an object on a measurement scale (grams).



3. Balance Builder ‑ Hard  
What the student sees  
• A two-pan balance.  
• Left pan: picture of a small backpack.  
• Right pan: empty.  
• Below the balance is a tray of movable standard masses: 1 kg, 500 g, 200 g, 100 g, 50 g, 20 g, 10 g (unlimited copies). The balance arm visibly tips as weights are added/removed.  

Interaction  
Drag any combination of standard masses onto (or off) the right pan until the balance beam is level. The item auto-records the total mass when level and submits when the student clicks “Done.”

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
There are many valid weight combinations; an MCQ would have to list them all and telegraph an answer. Text entry would hide whether the student understands how standard units combine to measure mass. Here, students physically demonstrate measurement—precisely the performance the standard calls for.

Skill focus  
Measure the mass of an object in kilograms/grams using standard units.



4. Label the Scales ‑ Medium  
What the student sees  
• Four separate photographs of platform scales, each with a different object already on it (toy car, pineapple, stapler, gallon of milk). The needles rest at various points (e.g., midway between tick marks).  
• A bank of four draggable mass-labels: “75 g,” “0.9 kg,” “350 g,” and “2 kg.”  

Interaction  
Drag each mass-label onto the matching photograph so that every scale receives one label.

Why drag-and-drop is essential  
The student must read each unique scale picture and simultaneously match all four values. Doing this through four independent MCQs would mask the integrative decision-making and allow chance success on each part. The all-or-nothing multi-match drag-and-drop demands holistic understanding.

Skill focus  
Read masses (both grams and kilograms) directly from differing scale visuals.","1. The Gram Grab (easy)  
Task: A grid shows eight everyday items (paper clip, baseball bat, cat, orange, school bus toy, textbook, piano, push-pin). Prompt: “Select ALL the items whose masses would most reasonably be recorded in grams rather than kilograms.”  
Why multiselect is essential: More than one correct answer and no single combination is obviously “best.” The learning goal is deciding when grams vs. kilograms are appropriate across several objects at once; forcing one-choice-only or fill-in-the-blank would under-assess whether students can apply the decision repeatedly.

2. Scale Snapshots Within a Range (medium)  
Task: Six photographs of pan balances are shown; each dial is marked in grams up to 2 000 g. Prompt: “Select EVERY scale that shows a mass greater than 500 g but less than 1 000 g.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Students must read each scale, convert the visual to a number, then apply a compound inequality to several cases. A single-response item could verify only one reading; the multiselect format checks correct/incorrect reasoning across many independent readings simultaneously.

3. Reasonable or Ridiculous? (medium)  
Task: Ten statements appear, each pairing an object with a mass and unit (e.g., “Bag of rice – 2 kg,” “Pencil – 150 g,” “Elephant – 3 kg,” “Laptop – 3 g”). Prompt: “Select ALL the statements that give a reasonable mass for the object.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Realistic sense of magnitude in both units is tested over numerous contexts. Only multiselect lets students show consistent judgment on multiple reasonableness decisions in one go; a single MCQ can’t capture that breadth.

4. Mixed-Unit Shopping Basket (hard)  
Task: A picture shows seven grocery items, each sitting on its own digital scale that displays either grams or kilograms (e.g., cheese 350 g, melon 1.4 kg, box of cereal 420 g, honey jar 750 g, small pumpkin 2.3 kg, chocolate bar 100 g, cauliflower 0.8 kg). Prompt: “You have a carrying limit of 4 kilograms. Select ALL the items you could carry together without exceeding 4 kilograms.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Students must interpret mixed-unit readings, convert when needed, add various combinations, and meet an inequality constraint. There are multiple correct subsets; scoring demands multi-selection. Neither MCQ nor single numeric entry can capture the flexible combinatorial reasoning required.",#REF!

Water used = starting amount − remaining amount
55L - 48L = 7L  
So, Ella used 7 liters of water to water her plants.

Question: A factory has 6 boxes with 5 kilograms of flour in each. What is the total mass of flour in all 6 boxes?  
<<alt: Image shows 6 identical boxes, each labeled '5 kg', lined up in a row.>>  
Answer: 30 kilograms  
Answer Explanation:  
To find the total mass, you need to combine the mass in each box.  
- There are 6 boxes.  
- Each box has 5 kilograms of flour.  
- Multiply the number of boxes by the mass in each box:  
  - 6 × 5 kilograms = 30 kilograms  
So, the total mass of flour in all 6 boxes is 30 kilograms.

Answer: No","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop","1. Trail-Mix Builder  – easy  
Problem stem (example): “Build a 250-g trail-mix bag for the hiking club. Drag scoops of ingredients into the bag until the scale reads exactly 250 g.”  
Screen set-up: • An empty bag sits on a digital scale that updates live. • 8–10 scoops, each permanently labelled with a mass (e.g., 15 g raisins, 25 g peanuts, 40 g pretzels, etc.), are lined up to the side.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: The task is open-ended (dozens of viable ingredient combinations). Listing every possible answer choice (MCQ) or requiring students to type a single number would not capture the combining process that shows additive reasoning. Only the correct total allows submission, so correctness = mastery of one-step addition of masses.

2. Juice Spill Stopper  – medium  
Problem stem (example): “A jug holds 600 mL of orange juice, but only 350 mL should remain after pouring some out. Drag measuring cups to remove juice until exactly 350 mL is left in the jug.”  
Screen set-up: • A jug with a visible level indicator. • Empty cups labelled 50 mL, 100 mL, 150 mL, 200 mL. When a cup is dropped on the jug, the fluid level drops and the running ‘mL left’ read-out changes.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: Students physically model subtraction by removing volumes. Multiple correct sequences exist (e.g., 250 mL = 100+150 or 50+200). Enumerating them in MCQ is impractical, and the visual feedback ties the subtraction to the context in a way text entry cannot.

3. Pail-by-Pail Planters  – medium  
Problem stem (example): “Each planter needs 4 L of water. There are 6 identical planters. Drag 4-L pails of water onto the planters to give every planter what it needs.”  
Screen set-up: • Six empty planter icons. • An unlimited stack of 4-L pails. When a pail is dropped on a planter it ‘pours’ in, disappears, and a small tag ‘4 L’ appears inside that planter.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: The student demonstrates multiplicative reasoning by repeating one equal amount exactly six times (one-step multiplication of volumes). The interface forces equal groups; a single numeric entry (“24”) would not require showing the grouping concept and could be guessed.

4. Fair-Slice Cheese Wheel  – hard  
Problem stem (example): “A chef must split an 18 kg cheese wheel equally into 6 smaller wheels. Drag 3-kg cheese wedges into each crate so that all crates get the same total mass and no cheese is left over.”  
Screen set-up: • Six empty crates. • A supply of identical 3-kg wedges cut from the big wheel. A running ‘Cheese left: __ kg’ counter decreases with each drag. Submission is enabled only when every crate shows the same mass and none of the original 18 kg remains.  
Why drag-and-drop is essential: Students must enact fair sharing (division) and monitor the diminishing total simultaneously. A single number response (“3 kg per crate”) or an MCQ would not require distributing the correct number of pieces and completely exhausting the original mass, both of which evidence full understanding of 18 ÷ 6.","1. Juice Pitcher Combos  (easy)  
Prompt idea – “A pitcher holds exactly 1 000 mL.  Select ALL of the choices that would fill the pitcher without spilling or leaving space.”  
Six answer choices mix one–step addition and multiplication, e.g.  
• 3 juice boxes that each hold 250 mL  
• 1 carton of 600 mL and 2 cartons of 200 mL  
• 4 bottles that each hold 300 mL  
• 2 cans of 500 mL  
• 200 mL + 300 mL + 400 mL  
• 900 mL + 150 mL  

Why multiselect is essential  
More than one combination works (e.g., 3×250 mL and 2×500 mL), while several near-miss distractors almost work.  The item demands that students solve each one-step situation and recognize every correct total.  A single-answer format would either give away which one is correct or ignore the equally-correct alternatives.  Text-entry would reduce the task to “type 1 000,” which fails to assess the reasoning.


2. Which Bakers Got It Right?  (medium)  
Prompt idea – “A sack of sugar weighs 840 g.  Each cupcake recipe needs 70 g of sugar.  Five classmates explain what they would do.  Select ALL students who solved the problem correctly.”  
Student statements (one per choice) include one-step multiplication or division, e.g.  
• Ava: “I divided 840 by 70 and got 12 cupcakes.” (correct)  
• Ben: “I multiplied 70 by 12 and got 820 g, so 12 cupcakes.” (incorrect mass)  
• Carlos: “I subtracted 70 g again and again until I reached 0; I counted 12 times.” (correct)  
• Dana: “I added 70 g six times and got 420 g, so 6 cupcakes.” (incorrect)  
• Eli: “I thought 70 g + 70 g = 140 g, so 140 cupcakes.” (incorrect operation)  

Why multiselect is essential  
Several classmates may be correct.  Students must judge each explanation independently, applying the one-step division or multiplication required by the problem.  A single-choice item could not acknowledge multiple valid solution paths, and free-response would not test the student’s ability to evaluate others’ reasoning.


3. Ladle Choices for the Soup Pot  (medium)  
Prompt idea – “A pot holds 2 400 mL of soup.  Select ALL ladle sizes that will let the cook serve the entire pot using an exact whole number of scoops.”  
Answer options (one-step division): 60 mL, 100 mL, 150 mL, 200 mL, 350 mL, 400 mL.  
Correct answers: 60 mL (40 scoops), 150 mL (16 scoops), 200 mL (12 scoops), 400 mL (6 scoops).

Why multiselect is essential  
More than one ladle size meets the condition.  Students must perform a separate one-step division for every option and decide “select / don’t select.”  A single-answer format would hide the richness of the task; text-entry would simply ask for one possible ladle size rather than verifying fluency across several numbers.


4. Equation Cards That Solve the Beef Problem  (hard)  
Prompt idea – “A butcher packs 125 g of ground beef into each slider patty.  He needs 1 000 g of beef altogether.  Select ALL equations that correctly solve the problem.”  
Eight equation cards mix addition, multiplication and subtraction:  
• 125 g × 8 = 1 000 g   (correct)  
• 1 000 g ÷ 125 g = 8   (correct)  
• 125 g + 125 g + 125 g + 125 g + 125 g + 125 g + 125 g + 125 g = 1 000 g   (correct)  
• 8 + 125 = 133   (incorrect)  
• 1 000 – 125 = 875   (incorrect)  
• 4 × 250 g = 1 000 g   (correct mass, wrong unit size)  
• 5 × 200 g = 1 000 g   (correct mass, wrong patty size)  
• 125 g × 6 = 750 g   (incorrect)  

Why multiselect is essential  
Multiple representations truly solve the same one-step word problem, and students must identify every one.  MCQ can show only one best answer; text-entry asks for just one equation or one number.

Today, you will learn how to:
* Create scaled picture graphs from data sets

## Scaled Picture Graphs

Picture graphs are used to represent data. On a **scaled picture graph**, a picture represents more than one item.

Scaled graphs help us show data where larger numbers are involved.

Let’s look at an example.

Nina recorded the number of pizzas sold over five days.

| Day       | Number of Pizzas Sold |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Monday    | 25                   |
| Tuesday   | 10                   |
| Wednesday | 15                   |
| Thursday  | 30                   |
| Friday    | 30                   |

If we want to create a picture graph for this data, we have to use a scale so that we won’t have to draw 45 pizzas in one row.

Since all of the number of pizzas sold are multiples of 5, let’s have each pizza represent 5 pizzas.

This means each pizza counts by 5.

<<A picture graph showing the number of pizzas sold each day from Monday to Friday, with each pizza icon representing 5 pizzas and totals listed for each day.>>

So our picture graph looks like this:

<<A picture graph showing the number of pizzas eaten each day from Monday to Friday, with each pizza icon representing five pizzas.>>

## Picture Halves in Picture Graphs

Sometimes we need to represent numbers that are half of the scale picture.

For example, look at this data:

| Player    | Number of Goals |
|-----------|----------------|
| Steven    | 4              |
| Brian     | 8              |
| Vinay     | 7              |
| Franklin  | 10             |
| Tyronne   | 11             |

Let’s say we make the scale 2 so that each soccer ball symbol represents 2 goals.

This would mean that half of a soccer ball symbol represents 1 goal.

We can then build our picture graph.

<<A picture graph showing the number of goals scored by five players using whole and half soccer ball symbols, where each whole ball represents 2 goals and each half ball represents 1 goal.>>

<<A picture graph showing the number of goals scored by five players, using whole and half soccer ball icons to represent two and one goals respectively.>>

So our picture graph would look like this:

Today, you will learn how to:
* Create scaled picture graphs from data sets

## 2. LEARNING CONTENT

### Understanding Scaled Picture Graphs

A **scaled picture graph** uses symbols where each symbol represents more than 1 item. The **scale** tells you how many real items each symbol represents.

**Example:** If each ⭐ = 5 students, then ⭐⭐⭐ means 15 students total.

### Choosing a Good Scale

When creating a picture graph, pick a scale that makes sense for your data:
- **Small numbers (under 20):** Use scale of 1 or 2
- **Medium numbers (20-50):** Use scale of 5 or 10  
- **Large numbers (over 50):** Use scale of 10, 20, or more

**Quick Check:** You have data showing 25, 30, 15, 20. What would be a good scale?
*Answer: Scale of 5 (so you'd need 5, 6, 3, and 4 symbols)*

### Creating the Graph from Data

**Steps to create a scaled picture graph:**
1. Look at your data numbers
2. Choose an appropriate scale
3. Divide each data number by the scale to find how many symbols needed
4. Draw the symbols for each category

<<A visual showing data ""Dogs: 20, Cats: 15, Birds: 10"" being converted to a picture graph with scale ""1 symbol = 5 pets"", showing 4 dog symbols, 3 cat symbols, and 2 bird symbols>>

STEP 1: Read the data and the key (what 1 symbol stands for).
STEP 2: For each category, find how many symbols it should have using the key (skip count by the key number to the data number, or do data ÷ key).
STEP 3: Check Choice A: compare each category’s number of symbols to what it should be; make sure names match the data.
STEP 4: Check Choices B, C, and D the same way; rule out any choice with a mismatch.
STEP 5: Pick the choice where every category and symbol count matches the data set exactly.","Instructional Approach

## Prerequisite skills
- Read and compare whole numbers to 100.

## Using Picture Graphs to Answer Questions

When you look at a picture graph, first check the **key**.

It tells you how many things each picture means.

Here’s an example of a key.

<<A pictogram key showing a whole apple representing two apples and a half apple representing one apple.>>

In the key above, every whole apple stands for two apples.

When you see half of an apple, it stands for one apple.

Imagine an apple tree farm selling apples. They keep track of their sales on the picture graph below.

<<A picture graph showing apples sold each day of the week, using whole and half apple icons to represent quantities, with a key indicating that a whole apple icon equals two apples and a half apple icon equals one apple.>>

We can answer many different questions just from looking at the graph.

Use the table below to see what questions you can answer and how to answer them.

| Question | Example | How to Solve | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Find how many objects are represented in one category. | How many apples were sold on Wednesday? | Use the key to add up how many total objects are in a category. | <<A picture graph showing apples sold each day of the week, using whole and half apple icons to represent quantities, with a key indicating that a whole apple icon equals two apples and a half apple icon equals one apple.>>\n**(2 × 2) + 1 = 5** |
| Find the total in all of the categories combined. | How many total apples were sold during the week? | Use the key to find how many total | <<A pictograph chart showing apples sold each day of the week, with apples representing whole and half quantities for Monday through Friday.>>\n**10 whole apples plus 3 half apples = (10 × 2) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23** |
| Compare two of the categories. | How many more apples were sold Monday than Friday? | Find how many items are represented in each group and subtract. | <<A comparison chart showing seven apples for Monday and three apples for Friday, with equations calculating the totals for each day.>>\n**7 - 3 = 4** |

STEP 5: Give the difference.","Instructional Approach
- Anchor in real-world contexts (classroom, school, community) with at most five categories and totals ≤100.
- Always start by reading the key/legend and identifying the scale (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10). If a half symbol is used, ensure it is shown in the key.
- Model converting symbols to numbers with skip-counting or repeated addition; record work in a table: Category | pictures | calculation | total.
- Progression: determine symbol value → single-category totals → overall totals → compare two categories (“how many more/fewer”).
- Require students to show work using numeric statements (e.g., 3 pictures × 10 = 30; + 5 for a half symbol), not variables.
- Emphasize operation choice: add for totals; subtract for “more/fewer/difference.”
- Check reasonableness: totals must be multiples of the scale; half-symbol values must match the key; 0 pictures = 0 items.
- Provide visual supports (skip-counting charts by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10) and structured sentence frames for explanations.
- Use quick formative checks (thumbs check, exit slip with one comparison) and immediate feedback tied to the key.

## Prerequisite skills
- Read and write whole numbers 0–100.
- Skip-count by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10.
- Add and subtract within 100.
- Understand equal groups/repeated addition.
- Read category labels and simple tables.
- Read and use a key/legend; recognize half of even-number values when provided (e.g., half of 6 is 3).

##Microskills
- Locate and interpret the key/legend and scale.
- Distinguish full symbol vs half symbol and use the value given in the key.
- Convert symbol counts to numbers by skip-counting or repeated addition.
- Record category totals in a table or t-chart.
- Compute an overall total by adding category totals.
- Compare two category totals and find the difference by subtraction.
- Decide the operation from words: total/altogether → add; how many more/fewer/difference → subtract.
- Check answers for reasonableness (multiples of scale; half-symbol value matches key; totals ≤100).
- Explain thinking with a brief numeric statement and the key value.

## Precise Vocabulary
- Picture graph: A graph that uses pictures to show data in categories.
- Key (legend): Tells how many items each picture (and half picture, if shown) represents.
- Scale: The number of items each symbol stands for (e.g., 1 picture = 6 items).

### Scaled Bar Graphs  
The numbers on the side of a bar graph are called the **scale**. The **scale** marks off equal sections.

Here are some bar graphs with different scales:

| Scale       | Bar Graph |
|-------------|-----------|
| Scale of 1  | <<A bar chart with three vertical bars of different colors and heights, representing data values for three categories.>> |
| Scale of 5  | <<A bar graph with three colored bars comparing the heights for L. Smith, P. Nguyen, and R. Mills on a scale of 10.>> |
| Scale of 10 | <<A bar graph with three colored bars comparing the number of books read on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, with Friday having the tallest bar.>> |

---

### Bar Heights
To find the bar height on a scaled bar graph, look to see where the top of the bar lines up with the scale.

<<A table and a bar graph showing the kilograms of cherries sold on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with arrows and labels highlighting the bar heights for each day.>>

## Prerequisite Skills
- Read and interpret simple data tables with categories and whole number values
- Understand basic multiplication facts (2s, 5s, 10s tables)
- Read number lines and identify positions of whole numbers
- Compare bar heights visually

## Microskills
- Identify the scale value on a scaled bar graph
- Read bar heights accurately from a scaled axis
- Verify that all bars in a graph correctly represent their corresponding data values
- Distinguish between different bar graph options based on scale and bar heights

## Precise Vocabulary
- **Scale**: The value that each unit or marking on the graph represents (e.g., each unit = 5 books)
- **Bar height**: How tall a bar extends on the graph, measured in units on the vertical axis
- **Data value**: The actual number being represented (e.g., 20 books sold)
- **Unit**: One space or marking on the graph axis
- **Vertical axis**: The up-and-down line on the graph that shows the scale
- **Category**: Each different group being measured (e.g., dogs, cats, birds)

## Question Stems
1. Which bar graph correctly represents this data using a scale of [number]?
2. Which bar graph accurately displays this information with each unit equal to [number]?
3. Which bar graph properly shows this data where each unit represents [number] [items]?
4. Which graph correctly represents the data?

## Step-by-Step Explanations

**Task: Given the data, match the bar graph that matches the data.**

STEP 1: Inspect every graph’s y‑axis. Identify the scale (e.g., “marks at 0, 5, 10 …”).

STEP 2: For each bar:

If the bar top is on a labeled tick → read that number.

If it is between two labels → count minor ticks from the lower label and add to get the value.

STEP 3: Compare the read‑off value with the table entry for that category.

Choose the graph where every bar matches its table value.

Task 2 – Read the data value of a single bar
STEP 1: Find the labeled scale on the y‑axis.
STEP 2: 
See where the bar ends:

On a label → use that label’s number.

Between labels → count minor ticks from the lower label, then add to the lower label’s value.

   • A ­fill-in-blank or MCQ cannot reproduce the physical act of pairing off and isolating the un-matched icons, which is exactly the one-step additive comparison the standard demands.

2. “Stack-to-Match Bars” (Bar Graph) – medium  
   • A vertical bar graph with a scale of 5 shows four snack choices. The bar for “Chips” is shorter than “Fruit” by two scale units.  
   • Beneath the graph is a pool of loose bar segments, each segment exactly one scale unit high and colored to match the Chips bar.  
   • Prompt: “Drag segments onto the Chips bar until it is as tall as the Fruit bar. How many segments did you need?”  
   • The scoring engine counts segments dropped on the bar; that total is the answer.  
   • The drag action forces students to use the graph’s scale and physically model the additive comparison, something a typed number or single-choice option cannot replicate.

3. “Multi-Match Equation Builder” (Frequency Table) – medium  
   • A frequency table lists counts for five pets.  
   • Three incomplete equations appear:  
        □ – □ = □  (Dogs vs. Cats)  
        □ – □ = □  (Fish vs. Birds)  
        □ – □ = □  (Rabbits vs. Fish)  
   • Number chips (all five category counts plus three distractors) are draggable.  
   • Students drag the correct chips into each blank, making sure the larger count is first and the computed difference is last.  
   • Because each chip can be used only once, correct placement across all three equations simultaneously is required, a complexity impossible to mirror with independent MC items or separate blanks.

4. “Difference Bracket Builder” (Line Plot) – hard  
   • A line plot shows “Number of pages read” with X’s stacked over 4, 5, 6, 7 pages.  
   • A visible bracket spans 5 and 7 pages with an empty “difference shelf” under it.  
   • Twenty small unit tiles (each = one reader) sit in a tray.  
   • Prompt: “Drag tiles onto the shelf to represent how many MORE readers read 7 pages than 5 pages.”  
   • Students must count the X’s above 7 and 5, compute the difference, and drag exactly that many tiles.  
   • The manipulative nature—building the difference with unit tiles in a bracket tied to the two marked categories—cannot be reduced to picking or typing a numeral without losing the spatial-quantitative reasoning the item elicits.","1. “Which Statements Match the Table?” ‒ easy  
Representation: Frequency table of favorite recess activities  

Prompt (MS):  
The table shows how many students chose each activity.  
Select ALL statements that the table makes true.  

Answer options (✓ = correct):  
✓ “Playing Tag has 3 more votes than Reading.”  
✗ “Kickball has 2 fewer votes than Tag.”  
✓ “Drawing has 5 fewer votes than Playing Tag.”  
✗ “Drawing and Reading together have 12 votes.”  
✓ “Kickball has 4 more votes than Drawing.”  

Why multiselect is essential  
• 3 separate correct comparisons exist; a single-answer MCQ cannot capture them.  
• A text-entry item would need multiple blanks and would not check that students recognize ALL valid additive comparisons.

2. “Spot the True Comparisons on the Bar Graph” ‒ medium  
Representation: Vertical bar graph with a scale of 2 (each grid line = 2 books) for books read by Classes A–D.  

Prompt (MS):  
Look at the bar graph. Select ALL true statements about how many MORE or FEWER books one class read than another.  

Answer options (✓ = correct):  
✓ “Class B read 4 more books than Class A.”  
✓ “Class C read 6 fewer books than Class B.”  
✗ “Class D read 2 more books than Class B.”  
✗ “Class A read 8 fewer books than Class D.”  
✓ “Class C read 2 fewer books than Class A.”  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Students must judge every statement individually, not just hunt for a single truth.  
• Only the MS format checks complete, all-or-nothing mastery of multiple one-step comparisons drawn from a scaled bar graph.

3. “True Facts from the Pictograph” ‒ easy  
Representation: Pictograph of after-school clubs (key: each smiley = 2 students).  

Prompt (MS):  
Select ALL statements that correctly describe how many MORE or FEWER students are in one club than another.  

Answer options (✓ = correct):  
✗ “The Music Club has 2 more students than the Art Club.”  
✓ “The Science Club has 2 fewer students than the Chess Club.”  
✓ “The Music Club has 6 more students than the Science Club.”  
✗ “The Chess Club has 4 more students than the Art Club.”  
✓ “The Art Club has 4 fewer students than the Music Club.”  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Evaluating multiple comparisons also requires interpreting the pictograph’s scale, a step lost in single-answer formats.  
• MS forces students to notice that more than one additive comparison is correct and to apply the key consistently.

4. “Line-Plot Logic” ‒ hard  
Representation: Line plot of ribbon lengths (cm) with X’s stacked over 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 cm.  

Prompt (MS):  
Select ALL statements that the line plot supports.  

Answer options (✓ = correct):  
✓ “There are 3 more ribbons that are 7 cm long than 9 cm long.”  
✗ “There are 4 fewer ribbons at 6 cm than at 8 cm.”  
✓ “There are 4 more ribbons at 8 cm than at 10 cm.”  
✗ “The number of 9 cm ribbons is 2 more than the number of 6 cm ribbons.”  
✓ “Together, the 6 cm and 10 cm ribbons equal the number of 8 cm ribbons.”  

Why multiselect is essential  
• Multiple correct one-step comparisons must be sifted from distractors, demonstrating depth of understanding of both the plot and additive reasoning.  
• Single-answer items cannot determine whether students can recognize ALL valid comparisons without guessing combinations, making MS the uniquely appropriate format.",#REF!

Today, you will learn how to:
* Match line plots with the data they show.

## Line Plots with Halves

Sometimes measurements are not whole numbers. They can be fractions.

A half means the whole is split into 2 equal parts.

On a number line, halves are halfway between whole numbers.

**Example:**

<<Number line from 4 to 6 in half-unit increments with arrowheads at both ends>>

If we have 4½ as a data point, we place an X above 4½.

Now, let’s look at a line plot filled from data from a list.

**Example:**

A group of students recorded how many hours they spent on screens after school in one day. The numbers of hours are:

4, 4½, 4½, 4½, 4½, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6.

<<Number line from 4 to 6 in half-unit increments with arrowheads at both ends>>

For every number in the list, we place an X above that number on the number line.

**Quick Check:** What number is halfway between 2 and 3 on the number line?
**Click to see answer:**
2½

---

## Line Plots with Quarters

We can also split each whole into fourths (quarters).

Fourths divide the space between whole numbers into 4 equal parts.

We mark them as ¼, ½, ¾.

**Example:**

<<Number line from 1 to 3 in quarter-unit increments with arrowheads at both ends>>

If we have 2¾ as a data point, we place an X above 2¾.

Let’s see how that looks when you take a collection of data and graph it on a line plot.

**Example:**

Students in a science club recorded how many hours they spent watching educational videos in one week. The results were:

6¼, 6¼, 6¼, 6¼, 6¼, 6¾, 7¼, 7¼, 7¼, 7¼, 7½, 7½, 7¾

<<Number line from 6 to 8 in quarter-unit increments with arrowheads at both ends>>

## Using Line Plots to Answer Questions
Line plots help us organize and read data. They also help us answer questions about the data.

Let’s look at some of the types of questions we can answer with them by looking at an example.

Imagine your baseball team is having a batting competition. Each student measures how far they could hit the ball. The distances are in meters, and some include halves and quarters.

Let’s say this is the line plot of the data:

<<Line plot titled 'Distance of Baseball Hits' showing distances from 15 to 17 meters in quarter-meter increments, X marks above number line for measured data>>

Here are some questions we could ask about it and how we can find the answer:

| Example | What to Do | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| How many students hit the ball 15 1/2 meters? | Count how many X’s are above 15 1/2 on the number line. | 3 |
| Which distance had the most hits? | Find which distance has the most X’s. | 15 1/2 |
| How many students participated in the competition? | Count how many X’s are on the whole graph. | 10 |
| How many more hits were 15 1/2 meters than 15 1/4 meters? | Subtract the two values. | 1 |
| How many distances were more than 15 3/4 meters? | Count the number of X’s in the distances greater than 15 3/4. | 1 |
| How many hits were not 15 1/2 meters? | Count all of the other X’s, not including the ones on 15 1/2. | 7 |
| How many more 15 3/4 meter hits would the class need to get the same amount as the 15 1/2 meter hits? | Subtract the values. | 1 |

Question: In Ms. Carter’s class, if you combine the number of students who read Fantasy and Mystery books, how many more students is that than the number of students who read Science Fiction books? <<A frequency table showing number of books read by students in four different genres: Mystery (12), Science Fiction (18), Fantasy (9), Biography (15)>>

Answer: 3

Answer Explanation:  
- First, find out how many students read Fantasy and Mystery books together:
  - Fantasy: 9 students
  - Mystery: 12 students
  - 9 + 12 = 21 students in total
- Next, see how many students read Science Fiction books:
  - Science Fiction: 18 students
- Now, compare the two totals:
  - 21 (Fantasy and Mystery) minus 18 (Science Fiction) = 3
- So, 3 more students read Fantasy and Mystery combined than Science Fiction.

Question: Total the symbols for Painting and Swimming, then state how many more points this is than for Biking. <<A pictograph where each symbol = 2 points. Hobbies: Biking (6 symbols), Reading (3 symbols), Painting (5 symbols), Swimming (4 symbols)>>

Answer: 6

Answer Explanation:  
- Turn symbols into points (each symbol is worth 2 points):
  - Painting: 5 symbols × 2 = 10 points
  - Swimming: 4 symbols × 2 = 8 points
- Add the points for Painting and Swimming together:
  - 10 + 8 = 18 points
- Find the points for Biking:
  - Biking: 6 symbols × 2 = 12 points
- Compare the totals:
  - 18 points (Painting and Swimming) minus 12 points (Biking) = 6
- There are 6 more points for Painting and Swimming combined than for Biking.

Question: Combine the number of students who brought 2 and 4 pencils. How many more is this than the students who brought 5 pencils? <<A line plot showing number of pencils: 2 pencils (••), 3 pencils (•••), 4 pencils (••), 5 pencils (•)>>

Answer: 3

Answer Explanation:  
- Count the marks for each:
  - 2 pencils: 2 students
  - 4 pencils: 2 students
  - 5 pencils: 1 student
- Add the students for 2 and 4 pencils:
  - 2 + 2 = 4 students
- Find out how many students brought 5 pencils:
  - 1 student
- Compare the totals:
  - 4 students (2 and 4 pencils) minus 1 student (5 pencils) = 3
- So, 3 more students brought 2 and 4 pencils combined than brought 5 pencils.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 36 boxes","MCQ, Graphing, Drag and Drop, Text Entry","1.  Combine-&-Balance Pictograph Tray  (easy)  
   • Screen shows a scaled pictograph of four snack choices; every popcorn icon = 2 votes.  
   • Under the chart are three labeled trays: “Add Popcorn + Pretzels”, “Grape Tray”, and a narrow “Difference Rail”.  
   • Students drag ONLY the pictograph icons (they are detachable copies) into the first two trays as directed. When they are sure the first tray contains exactly the right total for Popcorn + Pretzels, they drag the Grape icons into the second tray. They then slide any extra icons from the larger tray onto the Difference Rail until the two trays are balanced.  
   • Scoring checks that  
        a) the first tray holds the exact combined count,  
        b) the second tray holds the exact third-category count, and  
        c) the rail shows the correct leftover icons (each worth 2).  
   • Why D-n-D is essential: The student must physically re-aggregate and then visually compare the icons; there are dozens of possible icon arrangements, so the task cannot be reduced to one blank or a selectable option set.

2.  Stack-a-Bar Overlay  (medium)  
   • A scaled bar graph (scale 5) shows books read by four classes. Beneath it are loose “bar segments,” each segment = 5 books and colour-matched to the categories.  
   • Prompt: “Combine Blue + Green classes. Build that bar under ‘Combined’. Then slide enough Yellow segments next to it so their tops line up. Any extra combined height must be placed in the ‘How Many More?’ chute.”  
   • Student drags segments for Blue and Green into the empty “Combined” axis column, then moves Yellow segments beside it. Leftover segments are dragged into the chute.  
   • Autograde checks the exact number of Blue & Green segments, the alignment of Yellow segments, and the count of leftovers.  
   • Why D-n-D is essential: The comparison is performed spatially; success depends on correct physical stacking/alignment, a nuance impossible to capture with a single numeric response or MCQ.

3.  Double-Chip Frequency-Table Builder  (medium)  
   • A frequency table lists pets owned (Dog, Cat, Fish, Bird) with counts. Along the bottom sit numbered “count chips” (1–30). Two drop zones are shown: “Total of Dog + Fish” and “____ more / fewer than Cats.”  
   • Students drag one chip into the first zone that equals Dog + Fish. The moment they drop it, the phrase in the second zone auto-updates to “___ more than Cats” or “___ fewer than Cats” depending on which is larger. They must drag the correct chip into that second zone.  
   • Only the chips move; nothing is typed.  
   • Why D-n-D is essential: There are 30 chips, so random guessing is improbable; the two-step relationship (first chip determines the needed comparison relationship for the second) creates dynamic interdependence that fixed-choice items cannot replicate.

4.  Scoop-the-Dots Line-Plot Challenge  (hard)  
   • A line plot shows how many minutes eight students practiced piano (x-axis: minutes; each ✖ = one student).  
   • A tray titled “Total for 7-min + 9-min” and a second tray titled “Compare to 5-min” sit below.  
   • Students drag every ✖ above 7 min and 9 min into the first tray. They drag every ✖ above 5 min into the second. Any extra ✖ left in the larger tray must then be slid into the “Difference” strip until the two trays match.  
   • The system grades the final positions of all individual ✖ marks.  
   • Why D-n-D is essential: The learner must literally reorganize data points, respecting both category and cardinality; the item evaluates whether each dot was correctly reassigned, something that cannot be captured by a single typed number or picked option.

These four drag-and-drop designs each demand that the student physically combine and then compare categorical data in two distinct steps, exactly mirroring the targeted 3.MD.B.3+4 skill, while leveraging drag-and-drop interactions that cannot be replaced by simpler input types.","1. True Statements from a Pet-Adoption Table (easy)  
• Display a frequency table with four animal types.

  ☐ Dogs and Cats together are 5 more than Rabbits and Birds together.  
  ☐ Dogs and Rabbits together are 8 more than Cats.  
  ☐ Cats and Rabbits together are 14 fewer than Dogs.  
  ☐ Dogs and Cats together are 22 more than Birds.  
  ☐ Cats and Birds together are 2 fewer than Rabbits.  
• At least two check-boxes are correct; others are close distractors (wrong add, wrong compare sign, or ignore two-step requirement).  
Why multiselect is irreplaceable: students must judge EACH statement independently; there are multiple correct statements, so neither a single-answer MCQ nor one text entry suffices.

2. Sticker Contest – Scaled Bar Graph Facts (medium)

  ☐ Alice and Diego collected 4 fewer stickers than Ben.  
  ☐ Ben and Diego collected 2 more stickers than Cara.  
  ☐ Alice and Ben collected 4 fewer stickers than Cara.  
  ☐ Alice and Cara collected 14 more stickers than Diego.  
  ☐ Ben and Cara collected 26 more stickers than Diego.

  ☐ Sedans and SUVs together sold 8 more cars than Trucks.  
  ☐ SUVs and Vans together sold 12 more cars than Sedans.  
  ☐ Trucks and Vans together sold 12 more cars than SUVs.  
Key contains multiple truths; pictograph’s scaling forces students to translate symbols to numbers before adding and comparing. One-response formats cannot check each statement independently.

### Measuring Area with Unit Squares

**Area**

Area is the amount of space taken up by a figure.

Sometimes a figure will be covered by unit squares.

A unit square is a square with side lengths of 1 unit.

<<A single unit square with sides of equal length, outlined in black to illustrate the concept of one square unit.>>

The unit square has an area of 1 square unit.

That means that we can count the number of unit squares that cover the figure to find its area.

Here are some examples:

| Figure | Count of Unit Squares | Area |
|--------|----------------------|------|
| <<A rectangular grid divided into 18 equal unit squares arranged in 3 rows and 6 columns, illustrating the concept of area.>> | <<A rectangular grid divided into 18 numbered squares arranged in 3 rows and 6 columns, illustrating an area of 18 square units.>> | 18 square units |
| <<A geometric figure composed of two connected rectangular arrays, one with six squares on top of another with twelve squares, illustrating area concepts.>> | <<A diagram of a composite shape made of 12 numbered unit squares arranged in an L-shaped pattern.>> | 12 square units |
| <<A geometric figure composed of two connected rectangular arrays of unit squares, one with 3 squares and the other with 12 squares, illustrating area comparison.>> | <<A diagram of an irregular shape divided into 15 numbered square units, illustrating area calculation by counting squares.>> | 15 square units |

Question: What is the area, in square feet, of the rectangle shown on the grid? <<A 7x5 grid is shown. Each square is 1 square foot. A rectangle covers the grid from the top left corner, covering 6 columns and 4 rows, with the rest of the grid empty.>>  
Answer: 24  
Answer Explanation:  
To find the area of a rectangle on a grid, use these steps:
- Count how many squares (columns) the rectangle covers across. That is 6.
- Count how many squares (rows) the rectangle covers down. That is 4.
- Multiply the number of columns by the number of rows:  
  \(6 \times 4 = 24\)
- The area of the rectangle is 24 square feet because the rectangle completely covers 24 unit squares, each representing 1 square foot.

Question: What is the area, in square meters, of the shaded rectangle? <<A rectangle drawn on a grid of 1-square meter squares. The rectangle starts from the lower left and is 5 squares long and 2 squares high. All these squares are shaded in.>>  
Answer: 10  
Answer Explanation:  
To find the area of the shaded rectangle:
- Count how many squares the rectangle stretches across (length). That is 5 squares.
- Count how many squares the rectangle is tall (height). That is 2 squares.
- Multiply the length by the height:  
  \(5 \times 2 = 10\)
- The area of the shaded rectangle is 10 square meters because there are 10 unit squares, and each represents 1 square meter.

Answer: 12 square meters","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Garden Tiling ‒ easy  
Task: A 4 × 7 rectangle (outlined on a grid) appears next to a “stack” of identical square-inch tiles. Students drag individual tiles onto the grid until they believe the garden is completely covered. The system records the exact count of tiles successfully snapped into the outline; that count is the scored response.  
Why D-n-D is essential: The student must physically demonstrate one-to-one covering. A text box or MCQ could guess the number without proving every unit fits; drag-and-drop verifies the act of measuring by coverage.

2. Shade-a-Shape Spotlight ‒ medium  
Task: An L-shaped patio is drawn on a 1 cm grid. A tray holds 20 translucent “highlight squares.” Students drag a highlight onto every unit square that belongs to the patio (and nowhere else). The item auto-counts highlighted squares as the answer.  
Why D-n-D is essential: The assessment hinges on selecting each correct unit square, not just giving the final tally. Only an interactive drag action shows the student can correctly recognize and count all qualifying unit squares.

3. Snap-to-Fit Frame ‒ medium  
Task: A blank 10 × 10 inch grid is shown with two draggable corner handles that define a resizable rectangle. Students drag the handles so the frame exactly matches the dimensions of a pictured poster on the grid. When they release, the system counts the interior unit squares and records that area.  
Why D-n-D is essential: Mastery is shown by spatially aligning the frame’s borders with grid lines—an action impossible to capture through a simple numeral or option choice.

4. Mixed-Unit Packing Crate ‒ hard  
Task: A warehouse floor plan appears over a grid that simultaneously shows 1-ft and 1-m unit markers (different colors). The prompt asks for the area in square feet. A parts bin offers both 1 ft² and 1 m² tiles. Students must choose the correct unit tiles and drag them onto the rectangular storage zone until it is fully covered. The system checks that (a) only the correct-unit tiles were used and (b) every interior square is filled, then counts the tiles.  
Why D-n-D is essential: The student must actively select the proper unit size and execute a full coverage. Neither task (choosing unit + counting exact coverage) can be verified by MCQ or text entry without the interactive placement evidence.","Multiselect Ideas  

1. Tile-Shop Pick List – easy  
Students see six small rectangles drawn on a centimeter grid, each outlined in a different color. Prompt: “Select ALL tiles that have an area of 12 square centimeters.” From the six, three really are 12 cm² (e.g., 3×4, 2×6, and a 1×12), the others are not. A single fill-in or MCQ cannot capture whether the student can recognize every correct rectangle while ignoring the distractors.

2. Backyard Garden Filter – medium  
Five rectangular garden sketches are shown on a foot grid. Prompt: “Select every garden plan whose area is GREATER than 30 square feet but LESS than 40 square feet.” To answer, students must count squares in each plan and apply the stated range. Because more than one plan meets the condition, multi-select is essential; any single-answer format would either cue the correct area or force the item to break into multiple questions.

3. Mixed-Unit Sort – medium  
Eight rectangles appear, two each on grids labeled cm, in, ft, and an improvised “star” unit (each star square is drawn the same size on its grid). Prompt: “Select ALL shapes that cover exactly 18 of THEIR OWN unit squares.” The student must attend to the unit label and count correctly in four different measurement contexts. A single MCQ would have to reveal the answer choices and cannot assess simultaneous discrimination across unit types.

4. Truth-Statement Checker – hard  
Two rectangles (A and B) are shown on incomplete inch grids; some unit squares are missing so students must infer by counting visible lines and partial squares. Six statements are listed, e.g.,  
• “Rectangle A has an area of 24 square inches.”  
• “Rectangle B has twice as much area as Rectangle A.”  
• “Rectangle A could cover three 4-inch-by-2-inch postcards exactly.”  
Exactly two statements are true. Prompt: “Select ALL true statements.” This structure forces students to determine both areas first and then evaluate multiple logical claims, a process no single-answer format can test in one question.",#REF!

* Find the area of rectangles and squares by multiplying their side lengths

## Area with Unit Squares

You already learned that the area can be found by covering it with unit squares.
Sometimes the unit squares aren’t drawn for you.

<<A solid light green rectangle with side labels showing 3 units tall and 4 units wide, but no unit divisions drawn inside.>>

We can also think about this as 3 rows with 4 unit squares in each row.

<<The same rectangle from before, but now divided with dashed lines into a grid of unit squares, showing 3 rows and 4 columns.>>

Instead of counting all of the squares, we can multiply the lengths of the sides.
Since 3 × 4 = 12, the area of the rectangle is 12 square units.

## Measurements

When we measure length or width, we use units.  
A unit can be:

* centimeters (cm)
* inches (in)
* feet (ft)
* meters (m)
* yards (yd)

These tell us how long each side is.
But when we measure area, we are counting squares that fit inside. That’s why we write the answer as **square** units.

**Examples:**
If the sides are measured in inches, the area is in square inches.
If the sides are in centimeters, the area is in square centimeters.

This table shows several rectangles and the calculation for their areas.

<<A table showing three example rectangles with different area calculations displayed below each.>>

- Find the missing side length of a rectangle when you know the area and one side length.

## Finding the Missing Side of a Rectangle

To find the **area** of a rectangle, we multiply the sides to get the area. But sometimes the problem gives you the area and only one side.

For example, in this rectangle, we can see that the area is 12 square inches and that one of the sides is 2 inches. The other side length is missing.

<<Rectangle with area 12 square inches. Vertical side labeled 2 inches. Horizontal side labeled 6 inches.>>

We know that to find that area, they must have multiplied the missing number by 2 to get 12.

$ ? \times 2 = 12 $

To solve this, we can calculate 12 ÷ 2, so the missing number is 6.
This means that the missing side length is 6 inches.

<<Rectangle with area 12 square inches. Vertical side labeled 2 inches. Horizontal side labeled 6 inches.>>

Whenever you know the area and one side, find the missing side by dividing the area by the side you know.

## Solving Area Word Problems with Rectangles and Squares

For word problems that are looking for area, you want to read carefully to find the side lengths. Once you find them, multiply them together.

Always write the label as square units (square feet, square meters, etc.).

Let’s look at this word problem:

The classroom chalkboard is shaped like a rectangle. It is 8 feet long and 4 feet wide. What is the area of the chalkboard?

<<A rectangular chalkboard with labeled dimensions of 8 feet long and 4 feet wide.>>

Important numbers: 8 feet long and 4 feet wide

Multiply: 8 × 4 = 32

<<A rectangular chalkboard divided into a grid, labeled as 8 feet wide and 4 feet tall to illustrate area calculation.>>

Area = 32 square feet

The chalkboard has an area of 32 square feet.

### Watch for Squares in the Problem

If the shape is a square, you can assume that all sides are the same.

You only need one side length to solve.

Let’s look at an example:

A pizza box is shaped like a square. Each side is 10 inches long. What is the area of the top of the box.

<<A square pizza box with a 10-inch side is shown open with a pizza inside, illustrating the measurement of the box's top area.>>

<<A square pizza box with a pepperoni pizza inside, showing a 10 inch side labeled and a grid overlay for measuring area.>>

Side length: 10
Multiply: 10 × 10 = 100

Area = 100 square inches

The top of the pizza box has an area of 100 square inches.

   Core idea: Students have to construct a garden bed of a given area by dragging wooden plank “boards” (number-labeled tiles) onto the four unlabeled sides of a rectangle.  
   • Screen shows a blank rectangle representing the garden; each side has a faint drop-zone.  
   • A tray contains 8 draggable board tiles: two 3’s, two 4’s, two 5’s, two 6’s.  
   • Prompt: “Lay boards so that the garden’s area is exactly 24 ft².”  
   • Correct solution: drag a 4 onto both short sides and a 6 onto both long sides (4 × 6 = 24).  
   Why D-n-D is indispensable: The task demands four separate placements that must satisfy two constraints simultaneously (opposite sides equal AND product = target area).  A single MCQ or text box cannot capture multiple, position-dependent choices in one step without turning into four separate questions.

2.  Rug & Tag Matcher  – medium  
   Core idea: Match each rectangular rug description to the correct area tag.  
   • Four rug images are fixed on screen; each picture’s caption gives its side lengths (e.g., “length 7 ft, width 5 ft”).  
   • A pile of four draggable price tags shows only areas (e.g., 24 ft², 30 ft², 35 ft², 42 ft²).  
   • Students drag each tag onto the rug it belongs to.  All four must be placed correctly for credit.  
   Why D-n-D is indispensable: It is a one-to-many simultaneous matching exercise.  A single MCQ cannot capture the four-way permutation of answers; a fill-in-blank would need four separate fields and would not assess matching accuracy in one holistic action.

3.  Tile the Patio  – medium  
   Core idea: Physically demonstrate the area by covering a patio outline with 1×1 tiles.  
   • Scenario: “Cover Maya’s 5 ft by 7 ft patio completely with paving stones.”  
   • Screen shows a 5 × 7 grid.  A bin holds unlimited identical 1×1 tile icons.  
   • Students drag tiles until the entire grid is filled (35 tiles).  
   • Program auto-snaps tiles to squares; excess or missing tiles leave obvious gaps.  
   Why D-n-D is indispensable: The student must translate multiplication into repeated spatial placement.  There is no single “answer” to type; success is only detectable by the system once every grid square is covered—something MCQ or numeric entry cannot capture.

4.  Resize-to-Fit Stage Planner  – hard  
   Core idea: Students dynamically resize a stage sketch to hit a target area.  
   • A draggable corner “handle” on a ghost rectangle sits on a square grid (10 × 10).  
   • Prompt: “Drag the corner so the stage will measure exactly 32 m².”  
   • As the handle moves, live length and width readouts update (whole-number snapping).  
   • Student stops dragging when, for example, the readout shows 4 m by 8 m.  
   Why D-n-D is indispensable: The answer is a spatial action, not a discrete choice— only by dragging until the multiplicative condition is met can the student finish.  A conventional item would have to ask for both lengths separately, losing the interactive “build-to-spec” experience.","1. Patio Design Pick  – medium  
   Stimulus: A single image shows six rectangular patio “blueprints,” each drawn on a grid and labeled with whole-number side lengths (e.g., 3 m × 10 m, 4 m × 8 m, 5 m × 6 m, 2 m × 14 m, 6 m × 6 m, 7 m × 4 m).  
   Prompt: “Mr. Lopez bought exactly 30 square meters of patio pavers. Select ALL designs he could cover completely without cutting any pavers.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: More than one blueprint has area = 30 m² (e.g., 3×10, 5×6). An ordinary MCQ cannot present multiple simultaneously correct answers, and a fill-in-the-blank would require students to produce every design from scratch, assessing recall rather than recognition of area. Multiselect lets the item target the skill of computing and comparing several areas at once.

2. Story Sort: Squares of 16  – easy  
   Stimulus: Eight one-sentence real-world scenarios appear in a list (e.g., “A garden that is 4 ft long and 4 ft wide,” “A rug that is 8 ft long and 2 ft wide,” “A sandbox that is 4 ft on each side,” “A poster that is 5 ft long and 3 ft wide,” etc.).  
   Prompt: “Select ALL situations that describe a square with an area of 16 square feet.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Several, but not all, statements satisfy both conditions (square + 16 ft²). A single-answer MCQ cannot capture this, and text entry would devolve into listing sentences (“#1, #3, #7”), which is clumsy and shifts focus to writing instead of the mathematical concept.

3. Match the Reference Rectangle  – medium  
   Stimulus: A picture of one reference rectangle on a grid, labeled 6 cm × 5 cm. Below it are eight “dimension cards,” each with a pair of whole-number side lengths (e.g., 2 cm × 15 cm, 3 cm × 10 cm, 4 cm × 6 cm, 5 cm × 5 cm, 6 cm × 4 cm, 10 cm × 3 cm, 12 cm × 2 cm, 7 cm × 4 cm).  
   Prompt: “The reference rectangle has an area of 30 square centimeters. Select ALL dimension cards that show a rectangle with the same area.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Four cards yield 30 cm²; the rest do not. Only multiselect allows the student to show they have found every valid pair without guessing a single “best” answer.

4. Billboard Budget Crunch  – hard  
   Stimulus: A table lists six rectangular billboard options, giving length, width (whole numbers), and a note that printing costs $1 per square foot. A client’s maximum budget is $48.  
   Prompt: “Select ALL billboards the client could afford while staying within the $48 budget.”  
   Why multiselect is essential: Students must compute each area (cost), compare to the budget, and acknowledge that more than one billboard may meet the criterion. MCQ cannot capture the possibility of multiple correct billboards; text entry would force students to type several billboard names, creating scoring ambiguity that multiselect avoids.

- Use the distributive property to find the area of rectangles.


## Area and Rectangles

Area is the space inside a shape. We can find it by counting the unit squares inside the shape.

When we have a rectangle, we can use multiplication to find the area.

Sometimes, the multiplication we need is large or not a fact we know by heart. In these cases, we can use the distributive property to help us solve.


## Breaking Rectangles into Smaller Parts

We can break a large rectangle into two smaller rectangles using the distributive property.

For example, let’s look at the rectangle below:

<<A rectangle divided into a 13 by 6 grid; the left 7 columns are labeled 7 units, the right 6 columns are labeled 6 units, and the height is labeled 6 units. The left area is green, the right area is blue. 13 by 6 grid with two colored regions>>

To find the area, we need to calculate 6 × 13.

But, we can use the distributive property and break 13 into 7 + 6.

<<A rectangle divided into a 13 by 6 grid; the left 7 columns are labeled 7 units, the right 6 columns are labeled 6 units, and the height is labeled 6 units. The left area is green, the right area is blue. 13 by 6 grid with two colored regions>>

Now we can find the area of the two smaller rectangles individually:

6 × 7 = 42

6 × 6 = 36

Add them: 42 + 36 = 78 square units.

So, the area of the large rectangle is 78 square units.


## Working with the Equation

<<A diagram showing a 6 by 13 grid split as 7 green columns and 6 blue columns, along with two separate rectangles: green (6×7) and blue (6×6), and below, the computation (6×7)+(6×6)=42+36=78 square units.>>

The distributive property lets us write:

6 × 13 = (6 × 7) + (6 × 6) = 42 + 36 = 78 square units

",,"Question Type: text_entry  
Question: Using the diagram, write the equation that represents the total area of the rectangle using the distributive property.  
<<Visual: A grid rectangle partitioned into two subrectangles. The rectangle has a height of 4 units. One subrectangle has a length of 3 units, and the other has a length of 2 units (total length is 5 units). Side labels: left side 4 units; bottom side split into 3 units (left) and 2 units (right), with the entire bottom labeled 5 units. The two subrectangles are shaded in different colors.>>  
Answer: 4 × (3 + 2) = (4 × 3) + (4 × 2)  
Answer Explanation:  
To find the total area of the rectangle, multiply the height (4 units) by the total length (5 units):  
- \(4 \times 5 = 20\)

The rectangle is divided into two parts:  
- Left part: \(4 \times 3 = 12\)  
- Right part: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

Using the distributive property:  
\(4 \times (3 + 2) = (4 \times 3) + (4 \times 2) = 12 + 8 = 20\)

<<Visual: A large rectangle with height labeled 8 units and total width labeled 9 units. It is partitioned vertically into two subrectangles: the left subrectangle is 5 units wide and the right subrectangle is 4 units wide. Both subrectangles are 8 units tall.>>  
Answer: 8 × (5 + 4) = (8 × 5) + (8 × 4)  
Answer Explanation:  
The whole rectangle’s area is \(8 \times 9 = 72\).  
Breaking the width into 5 + 4 gives areas \(8 \times 5 = 40\) and \(8 \times 4 = 32\); \(40 + 32 = 72\).

Question: Which equation is represented by the diagram?  
<<Visual: A rectangle with height labeled 9 units on the left vertical side. The rectangle is partitioned vertically into two subrectangles: the left subrectangle is 5 units wide, and the right subrectangle is 4 units wide. The full bottom side is labeled 9 units, with the two segments labeled 5 units and 4 units respectively. These two subrectangles therefore have dimensions 9 × 5 and 9 × 4.>>  
Options:  
- 9 × (5 + 4) = (9 × 5) + (9 × 4)  
- 5 × (9 + 4) = (5 × 9) + (5 × 4)  
- 4 × (9 + 5) = (4 × 9) + (4 × 5)  
- 9 × (4 + 1) = (9 × 4) + (9 × 1)  

Answer: 9 × (5 + 4) = (9 × 5) + (9 × 4)  
Answer Explanation:  
The rectangle’s height is 9 units and its width is split into 5 units and 4 units. By the distributive property, \(9 \times (5 + 4) = (9 \times 5) + (9 \times 4)\).","Worked Example #1

Answer: 70","MCQ, Drag and Drop, Text Entry, Multiselect","1. Snap-the-Cut (easy)  
Task type: Drag a partition line.  
Screen shows a gridded a × (b + c) rectangle with its side lengths already labeled a and (b + c).  A thin movable dotted line (the only draggable object) sits on the side tray.  The student drags the line onto the rectangle and “snaps” it to one vertical grid line so the interior is split into two smaller rectangles whose widths match the separately labeled b and c segments that appear only after the line is released.  
Why D&D is essential: The student demonstrates spatially that one physical cut can tile the large region into two exact sub-rectangles.  A multiple-choice or text entry item could ask “Where would you cut?”, but only dragging the cut onto the actual grid verifies the student can locate and create the tiling, not merely name a gridline.

2. Cover-the-Canvas (hard)  
Task type: Drag whole rectangles.  
The screen shows a faint outline of an a × (b + c) rectangle.  Off to the side are exactly two rigid, colored rectangles: one a × b, the other a × c (each labelled).  The student must drag these two shapes into the outline so they completely fill it without overlap or gaps; pieces snap only when they fit perfectly.  
Why D&D is essential: The act of physically covering the larger area with the two given areas is the concrete “tiling” required by the standard.  No text or MCQ can replicate the need to align, orient, and verify that the two areas together exhaust the space.

3. Label-the-Areas (medium)  
Task type: Drag equation tags.  
A pre-partitioned rectangle is shown (already cut into a × b and a × c parts).  Three blank drop-zones sit: one on each sub-rectangle and one beneath the entire figure.  In a tray are the three expression tiles “a × b”, “a × c”, and “a × ( b + c )”.  The student drags each tile to the matching zone.  
Why D&D is essential: The spatial placement of each symbolic expression onto the exact region it represents forces the student to connect geometry and algebra simultaneously—something a simple fill-in blank or pick-one list cannot compel.

4. Picture-to-Equation Pair (medium)  
Task type: Drag miniature diagrams.  
Right side: three distributive-property equations (e.g., 6 × (4 + 3) = 6 × 4 + 6 × 3) each with a large drop-zone beside it.  
Left side: three small, different partitioned-rectangle images (drawn on identical grids but with differing a, b, c values).  The student drags each diagram to the equation it models.  
Why D&D is essential: Because multiple diagrams may appear visually similar, placing the correct one demands the learner analyze side lengths and partitioning in two representations at once; simple radio-button matching would devolve into elimination guessing, whereas D&D leverages spatial reasoning and one-to-one pairing that text can’t.","Multiselect Ideas (Top 4)

1. “Pick Every Equation That Fits” ‒ easy  
Students see one 3 × (2 + 4) rectangle drawn on a grid, partitioned into 3 × 2 and 3 × 4 smaller rectangles. Side-length labels are shown. Below the picture is a list of 8 equations written in different—but mathematically equivalent—forms (array forms, factored forms, and expanded forms). At least three of those equations correctly represent the pictured tiling; the rest do not.  
Task: “Select ALL equations that the diagram proves are true.”  
Why multiselect is essential: There are multiple valid representations (e.g., 3 × (2 + 4) = 3 × 2 + 3 × 4 and 3 × 6 = 6 × 3) and any subset of them could be correct, so a single-answer MCQ cannot measure whether students can recognize *every* correct equation while rejecting the incorrect ones.

2. “Which Pictures Match the Equation?” ‒ medium  
Prompt shows the equation 5 × (2 + 3) = 5 × 2 + 5 × 3. Six miniature grid diagrams appear; each shows rectangles of different orientations, partitions, or mislabeled dimensions. Exactly two of them correctly visualize the given equation (one horizontal, one vertical).  
Task: “Select ALL diagrams that prove the equation is true.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Students must identify every diagram that works, not just one. A fill-in or single-choice item would reveal the key by elimination or ignore the “all that apply” requirement.

3. “Find All Correct Diagram-and-Equation Pairs” ‒ medium  
Eight option cards are shown; each card contains (a) a partitioned rectangle with side lengths labelled and (b) an equation printed directly beneath that specific diagram. Some cards are correct matches (diagram dimensions agree with the equation’s distributive decomposition) and some are mismatches (wrong dimensions or wrong addition factors).  
Task: “Select EVERY card in which the equation matches its diagram.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Each card stands alone; more than one can be correct. Assessing the ability to coordinate two representations simultaneously can only be done when students may choose multiple cards independently.

4. “All the Ways to Decompose This 4 × 9 Rectangle” ‒ hard  
A 4 × 9 grid rectangle (unpartitioned) is displayed. Beneath it are ten additive area statements that all *use* 4 as one factor but break the 9 into two whole-number addends in various ways, e.g.:  
• 4 × (5 + 4) = 4 × 5 + 4 × 4  
• 4 × (6 + 3) = 4 × 6 + 4 × 3  
• 4 × (7 + 2) = 4 × 7 + 4 × 2  
• … (plus several incorrect or irrelevant statements such as 4 × (5 + 3) = 4 × 5 + 3 × 4).  
Task: “Select ALL statements that you can prove using a tiling of the 4 × 9 rectangle.”  
Why multiselect is essential: Multiple decompositions of 9 are valid; students must accept all correct ones and reject distractors that violate the distributive structure. A single-response format cannot capture that nuanced judgment.

These four ideas together cover both directions of the standard (diagram → equation and equation → diagram) at varying depths, and each relies on the “select all that apply” nature of multiselect to assess comprehensive understanding that no other item type can evaluate as effectively.",#REF!

* Find the area of combined rectangles and squares by splitting them into smaller parts.

## Area Is Additive

Some shapes are made by putting smaller shapes together. These are called complex shapes.
When shapes are combined, their areas add together.

<<Two rectangles, one with 5 square units and one with 7 square units, shown adding to make an L-shaped figure with 12 square units.>>

That means we can break a large shape into smaller rectangles or squares, find each part’s area, then add them up.

Look at the shape below.

<<A complex L-shaped figure with side lengths in kilometers labeled all around: 14 km, 5 km, 2 km, 5 km, 7 km, and 9 km, all in blue.>>

First, break up the shape into rectangles and identify their lengths and widths.

<<L-shaped figure with a dashed line showing how to split it into two rectangles for easier area calculation.>>

Next, find the area of your rectangles.

<<The divided rectangles in the composite shape are labeled with their areas: 35 square kilometers and 45 square kilometers.>>

Add the areas together.

<<A math sum showing 35 plus 45 equals 70, followed by '70 square kilometers,' in red.>>

Question: Calculate the area of each of the three rectangles, and then find the total area of the large rectangle by adding these areas together. Show all calculations and reasoning. <<A diagram shows a large rectangle measuring 12 units wide and 9 units tall. Inside, the rectangle is partitioned by lines into three non-overlapping smaller rectangles: Rectangle A (upper left, 5 × 4), Rectangle B (upper right, 7 × 4), Rectangle C (bottom, 12 × 5).>>  
Answer:  
Answer Explanation:  
To find each area, multiply the width by the height for each rectangle:
- Rectangle A: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) square units
- Rectangle B: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) square units
- Rectangle C: \(12 \times 5 = 60\) square units

To find the total area, add the areas of all three rectangles:
- \(20 + 28 + 60 = 108\) square units

This shows the additive property of area: the area of a large rectangle can be found by adding the areas of its non-overlapping parts.

Question: Find the width of Rectangle Y. 
<<Two rectangles placed side-by-side form a larger rectangle. Rectangle X (left) is 6 × 8. Rectangle Y (right) has an area of 56 sq units. The total area of the large rectangle is 104 sq units.>>  
Answer:  
Answer Explanation:  
First, find the area of Rectangle X:
- \(6 \times 8 = 48\) square units

Rectangle Y has an area of 56 square units.

Add the areas: \(48 + 56 = 104\) square units, which matches the total area given.

Both rectangles have the same height (8 units), so to find the width of Rectangle Y, divide its area by its height:
- \(56 \div 8 = 7\) units

The width of Rectangle Y is 7 units. The additive property means the total area comes from adding the non-overlapping parts.

Question Type: mcq  
Question: What is the width of Rectangle B?  
A) 4 units  
B) 5 units  
C) 7 units  
D) 35 units  
<<A rectangle is divided by a vertical line into two rectangles A and B. Rectangle A is 4 units wide and 7 units tall. Rectangle B shares the same height and has an area of 35 sq units.>>  
Answer: B  
Answer Explanation:  
To find the width of Rectangle B, divide its area by its height:
- \(35 \div 7 = 5\) units

Rectangle B is 5 units wide because width multiplied by height gives area, and both rectangles share the same height.

Question: Find the width of the left rectangle and the area of the whole rectangle. <<A large rectangle is partitioned into three vertical rectangles: Left (unknown width, height = 13), Middle (9 units wide, height = 13), Right (5 units wide, height = 13). Total width = 25 units.>>  
Answer:  
Answer Explanation:  
Let the width of the left rectangle be \(x\).

Add the widths of all three rectangles:
- \(x + 9 + 5 = 25\)
- \(x = 25 - 9 - 5 = 11\) units

So, the left rectangle is 11 units wide.

To find the area of the whole rectangle, multiply the total width by the height:
- \(25 \times 13 = 325\) square units

Check by finding the area of each part:
- Left: \(11 \times 13 = 143\) square units
- Middle: \(9 \times 13 = 117\) square units
- Right: \(5 \times 13 = 65\) square units

Add the parts:
- \(143 + 117 + 65 = 325\) square units

This confirms the total area.

Question: Find the area of the fourth rectangle. Show your work. <<A large rectangle is partitioned into four rectangles. Three areas are labeled: 24 sq units, 35 sq units, 18 sq units. The total area is 100 sq units.>>  
Answer:  
Answer Explanation:  
Add the areas of the three labeled rectangles:
- \(24 + 35 + 18 = 77\) square units

Subtract this sum from the total area to find the missing area:
- \(100 - 77 = 23\) square units

The area of the fourth rectangle is 23 square units. This uses the additive property: the total area is made up of all the non-overlapping parts.","Worked Example #1

Answer: 24 square units","MCQ, Drag and Drop, Multiselect, Text Entry","1. Patch the Patio (easy)  
Task set-up  
• On a square grid the outline of an L-shaped patio is shown.  
• Four ready-made “paving-stone” rectangles (e.g., 4 × 1, 3 × 2, 2 × 2, 1 × 3) sit in a tray. Each tile’s size is visually obvious; no numbers need to be typed.  
Student action (single focus = drag)  
Drag the tiles into the outline until the shape is completely covered with no overlaps or gaps.  
Why drag-and-drop is indispensable  
The student must mentally decompose the irregular outline into the given rectangles (recognizing that the whole area equals the sum of the parts). An MCQ or text entry cannot replicate the spatial reasoning and trial-and-error decomposition inherent in physically fitting the pieces.

2. Label Each Room (medium)  
Task set-up  
• A rectangular “floor plan” is partitioned into three non-overlapping rooms. Side lengths are marked on every segment of the diagram.  
• Four draggable area tags are provided (e.g., 12 sq u, 18 sq u, 24 sq u, 30 sq u). One tag is a distractor.  
Student action (single focus = drag)  
Drag one area tag onto each room so that every room is correctly labeled. One tag will be left unused.  
Why drag-and-drop is indispensable  
This is a simultaneous three-way match. The learner must compute all three areas and correctly pair each with the right rectangle, not simply state a single value. A single-response MCQ or three separate blanks would not capture the holistic matching demand or permit instant self-correction by rearranging tags.

3. Drop the Dividers (medium)  
Task set-up  
• A blank 8 × 6 rectangle is shown with three faint “slot” positions where vertical or horizontal dividers could snap in.  
• Two draggable divider bars (one vertical, one horizontal) sit in a tray.  
• A legend shows the target areas that should appear after partitioning: 12 sq u, 20 sq u, 16 sq u (total = 48 sq u).  
Student action (single focus = drag)  
Drag each divider into one of the slot positions (or leave it unused) until all three target areas are produced. Only one placement combination yields the required three areas.  
Why drag-and-drop is indispensable  
The learner must reason additively in reverse: positioning the cuts so the resulting rectangles’ areas add to the stated totals. Because the bars can move to several locations, the solution space is far larger than any feasible MCQ list, and a text entry item could not capture the spatial decision-making.

4. Pick the Cut-Outs (hard)  
Task set-up  
• An outer 10 × 8 rectangle represents a poster board.  
• Five potential “window” rectangles, each labeled with its dimensions (e.g., 2 × 2, 2 × 3, 3 × 4, 2 × 6, 4 × 6), are draggable.  
• The goal statement reads: “Drag windows onto the board so the shaded (remaining) area is exactly 52 square units.”  
• Five fixed drop zones are outlined on the board; any combination of windows may be used, but they cannot overlap.  
Student action (single focus = drag)  
Drag whichever windows you choose into the drop zones. The item scores correct when the total area removed produces 52 sq u of remaining area.  
Why drag-and-drop is indispensable  
Students must select and combine areas to subtract from the whole, demonstrating that area of the shaded region = whole – sum(cut-outs). The open choice of both which and how many windows to insert creates combinatorial possibilities impossible to reproduce meaningfully in MCQ form, and no typing is required.

Each item directly assesses “area is additive” and relies on a single, clear drag action, keeping the UI simple while making substitution by text entry or MCQ infeasible.","1. Patio Puzzle (easy)  
Task type addressed: “Add the areas of non-overlapping rectangles and squares to determine the total area of a shape.”  
Prompt idea: A drawing shows a patio made of 3 labeled rectangles that do not overlap. To the right is a list of 8 numerical or algebraic statements (e.g., “6 × 4 + 3 × 4 + 4 × 2”, “24 + 12 + 8”, “44 ft²”, “(6 + 3) × 4 + 4 × 2”). Students must Select ALL statements that correctly give the patio’s total area.   
Why multiselect is irreplaceable: There are 3–4 correct statements, each expressed differently (numeric, factored, verbal). A single-answer MCQ cannot capture the idea that many equivalent additive representations exist, and a blank would only check one of them. The multiselect format forces students to test every option against the additive-area idea instead of just computing once.

2. Missing Tile Mystery (medium)  
Task type addressed: “Calculate the unknown area of one rectangle in a composite figure when the figure’s total area and the areas of all the other rectangles are provided.”  
Prompt idea: A composite floor diagram shows four rectangles; three have areas given (18 m², 12 m², 20 m²). The whole floor is labeled 70 m². A list of 7 equations or reasoning chains appears, such as “18 + 12 + 20 + ? = 70, so ? = 20”, “70 – 18 – 12 – 20 = 20”, “? = (5 × 4)”, “? = 40”. Students select all lines that correctly determine the missing rectangle’s area.   
Why multiselect is irreplaceable: More than one line of reasoning is valid; others contain a common arithmetic slip (e.g., subtracting in the wrong order). Only multiselect lets students demonstrate they can recognize EVERY correct use of additive area and reject flawed ones, something a single-response item can’t measure.

3. Shared-Side Detective (medium-hard)  
Task type addressed: “Given a large rectangle partitioned into non-overlapping rectangles, determine every missing length using shared sides, calculate each smaller rectangle’s area, and add the partial areas.”  
Prompt idea: A gridded drawing shows a big 8 cm by ? cm rectangle cut into three smaller rectangles. Several side lengths are missing but can be inferred. Ten statements are listed (e.g., “The unlabeled vertical side is 3 cm”, “Area of the upper right rectangle is 15 cm²”, “Total area is 56 cm²”, etc.). Exactly 4–5 statements are correct. Students must select all correct statements.   
Why multiselect is irreplaceable: Success requires judging several independent facts (lengths, partial areas, total area), not delivering a single number. Only multiselect checks the full network of additive reasoning in one shot; MCQ or a single blank would sample only one strand.

4. Shaded Garden Cut-outs (hard)  
Task type addressed: “Compute the shaded (unknown) region by subtracting areas of cut-out rectangles from an outer rectangle.”  
Prompt idea: Picture a 10 m by 7 m garden with two rectangular ponds removed. Five algebraic/numeric expressions are shown, each claimed to equal the shaded garden area, for example  
• 10 × 7 – (4 × 2 + 3 × 1)  
• (10 – 4) × 7 – (3 × 1)  
• 70 – 8 – 3  
• 10 × (7 – 2) – 3 × 1  
• (10 × 7) – (2 × 4) – (3 × 3)  
Students pick all expressions that really produce the shaded area.   
Why multiselect is irreplaceable: Multiple distinct yet valid additive/subtractive decompositions coexist, while some near-miss options test misconceptions (e.g., subtracting only one pond). Capturing the idea that several different additive pathways reach the same area can only be assessed when students are allowed (and required) to choose more than one correct answer.

These four items collectively hit every bullet task under the sub-standard while exploiting multiselect’s unique power to require recognition of ALL correct additive-area representations rather than just one.",#REF!

- Calculate the area for a compound shape that has missing side lengths

## Look for Missing Sides

You already know that we can split a compound shape into rectangles, find their areas, and add them. But what if a side length is missing?

Sometimes, a rectangle inside a larger shape does not have all its side lengths labeled. A missing side can often be found by comparing other sides of the shape. You can use addition.

<<Table showing two different compound shapes, highlighting which numbers to add up to find the missing side length.>>

**Quick Check:** Find the missing sides.

<<Compound shape with missing sides on the bottom and the right.>>
**Click to see answer:**
Bottom side: 9 cm + 5 cm = 14 cm.
Right side: 4 cm + 4 cm = 8 cm.

## Finding Areas with Missing Sides

Look at this figure.

<<Compound shape with missing sides, undivided.>>

Split the shape into two rectangles.

<<Compound shape with missing sides, split into two rectangles.>>

Begin with the piece you know best.
Look at the bottom rectangle.
- You know its width: 4 m.
- You know its height: The right side shows 5 m for the vertical piece.

<<Compound shape with missing sides, split into two rectangles, one rectangle calculated.>>

Area:
4 × 5 = 20 square meters

Next, let’s look at the top rectangle.
- The width is labeled as 2 m.
- The length includes the 4 from the bottom rectangle plus the 2 from the part of the length that we are given.

<<Compound shape with missing sides, missing side now calculated.>>

Area:
6 × 2 = 12 square meters

Now that we have the areas of both rectangles, we can add them to get the total.

<<Compound shape with missing sides, area fully calculated.>>

<<Final area calculation.>>

So we know this figure has an area of 32 square meters.

### Using Properties to Find Missing Sides

Sometimes a word problem does not give you all the sides of a shape. We can use the properties of rectangles and squares to figure out the missing sides. Then, we can find the perimeter.

### Properties of Rectangles

All rectangles have opposite sides that are equal. We can use this property when we are only given two of the side lengths.

<<Using the rectangle property of opposing sides the same length.>>

**Quick Check:** What are the missing sides of this rectangle?

<<Rectangle with 2 known sides and 2 unknown sides.>>

**Click to see answer:** The missing sides are the same as the sides across from them. If one side is 5 units, the opposite side is also 5 units. If one side is 3 units, the opposite side is also 3 units.

### Properties of Squares

All squares have all equal sides. That means if we know one side, we know them all.

<<Using the square property of all sides the same length.>>

**Quick Check:** What are the missing sides of this square?

<<Square with 1 known side.>>

**Click to see answer:** All the missing sides are the same as the given side. If one side is 6 units, then every side is 6 units.

- Find the missing side length of a polygon when you know the perimeter and the other side lengths.

## Finding the Missing Side of a Shape

When you know the perimeter of a shape and all but one of its side lengths, you can find the missing side.

Here's how:
1. Add up the sides you already know.
2. Subtract that number from the perimeter.

**The answer is the missing side.**

**Example:**

<<Quadrilateral with three known sides and one unknown side, total perimeter 28 units. The missing side is 6 units.>>

## Shapes with All Sides the Same Length

Some shapes have sides that are **all the same length**, like a square. When this happens, you can find the side length by **dividing the perimeter by the number of sides**.

**Example:**

<<Square with perimeter of 20 cm and an equation 20 ÷ 4 = 5 cm.>>

Each side is **5 centimeters long.**

## Finding the Missing Sides When Two Are the Same

Sometimes, a rectangle or square problem gives you the perimeter and shows one side, but the other two sides are missing. Because rectangles and squares have opposite sides the same length, those two missing sides will **match each other**.

1. **Add up the sides you know.**
2. **Subtract that number from the perimeter.**
3. **Divide the answer by 2**, because the two missing sides are the same length.

**Example:**

<<Rectangle with a perimeter of 24 meters, two sides labeled 8 meters, the other two labeled with question marks.>>

Add the sides you know: 8 + 8 = 16  
Subtract: 24 − 16 = 8  
Divide by 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4

**Each missing side is 4 meters long.**

Answer: 9 cm","MCQ, Text Entry, Drag and Drop, Multiselect","1. Build-a-Perimeter Hexagon (Medium)  
Task: An unlabeled hexagon outline has six empty “edge slots.” A tray contains ten detachable length tiles (e.g., 2 u, 3 u, 4 u, 5 u, 6 u, 7 u, 8 u, 9 u — a few are duplicated). The prompt says, “Drag one tile onto each side so that the total perimeter is exactly 24 units.”  
Drag Focus: Students must choose AND place six numbers whose spatial locations matter; there are dozens of possible combinations, so a single-answer MCQ or numeric entry cannot capture the open-ended selection plus placement.

2. Digit-Drop Missing Side (Easy)  
Task: A pentagon shows 4 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 3 cm, and one blank side. A banner states, “The total perimeter is 22 cm.” Below are unlimited single-digit tiles 0-9. Learners drag one digit tile into the blank side to name the missing length.  
Drag Focus: Instead of picking from a small option list, pupils build the value themselves from ten digit tokens, allowing any 1- or 2-digit solution; the open canvas of digits makes MCQ or simple text entry an inadequate substitute.

3. Story-to-Shape Match-Up (Medium)  
Task: Three movable “story cards” describe playground fences (“A triangle with sides 5 m, 5 m, and 4 m,” etc.). Four fixed polygon images (with side lengths) sit above. Students drag each story card onto the one polygon whose perimeter it matches; one polygon will remain unmatched.  
Drag Focus: The many-to-many matching (three stories, four shapes) plus the need to dock cards onto targets is far richer than picking one answer at a time; it assesses calculation and comparison simultaneously, which MCQ cannot replicate without four separate questions.

4. Perimeter Bucket Sort (Hard)  
Task: Five irregular polygons, each fully labeled, float on the left. On the right are three “collection bins” tagged “Perimeter < 18 u,” “18 – 25 u,” and “> 25 u.” Students drag every polygon into the correct bin.  
Drag Focus: Learners must compute each perimeter, compare it to interval bounds, and sort multiple objects in one action set; this multidimensional classification is not practically deliverable through fill-in or single-select formats.","1. Garden Fences (easy)  
Task type hit: “Select the polygon(s) that meet a given perimeter value.”  
Prompt idea  
Four small garden‐bed diagrams are shown (a square, a rectangle, an L-shaped pentagon, and a trapezoid).  Side lengths are labelled.  Students are told, “Lina has exactly 24 m of fencing.  Select ALL gardens she could fence completely without cutting any boards.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable  
• More than one diagram satisfies 24 m; others do not.  
• A single-answer MCQ would hide the fact that multiple correct diagrams exist, and a text entry would not let students communicate a set of choices.  
• The power of the item is in requiring evaluation of each shape individually—precisely what multiselect captures.

2. Missing Board Lengths (medium)  
Task type hit: “Determine the missing side length when the total perimeter is given.”  
Prompt idea  
A pentagon is pictured with four of its sides labelled 6 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm and one side left blank.  “The perimeter must be 29 cm.  Which of the following could be the length of the missing side?  Select ALL that work.”  
Choice set: 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm.  
Why multiselect is indispensable  
• More than one length makes the equation true (4 cm and 7 cm both complete 29 cm).  
• An MCQ would force the item writer to throw away one legitimate solution; a fill-in-the-blank would prompt students to supply a single number, losing the idea that multiple solutions are possible.  Multiselect alone allows the assessment to probe whether students recognize every valid option.

3. Whose Story Has 28 ft? (medium)  
Task type hit: “Calculate the perimeter from a verbal description.”  
Prompt idea  
Six short word problems are listed, each describing a different polygon (e.g., “A triangular flower bed with sides 9 ft, 8 ft, 11 ft,” “A rectangular rug 6 ft by 7 ft,” etc.).  Students must “Select ALL stories that describe a perimeter of exactly 28 ft.”  
Why multiselect is indispensable  
• The cognitive work is in computing all six perimeters and comparing them to 28 ft.  
• A standard MCQ can check only one story; separate text boxes would test each in isolation rather than the synthesis of scanning a set and identifying every match.  Multiselect lets the student demonstrate complete and partial understanding in a single response.

4. Gallery Wall Design (hard)  
Task type hit: “Given several polygons with side lengths, decide which meet a stated perimeter.”  
Prompt idea  
Eight irregular quadrilaterals are sketched on a “gallery wall” blueprint.  Side measures are shown.  The curator has 36 m of frame material.  “Select ALL quadrilaterals that can be fully framed with exactly 36 m of material.”  
Extra depth: at least one diagram includes a missing side marked with a letter and its opposite side length so students must deduce the missing length before checking the total.  
Why multiselect is indispensable  
• Multiple correct and multiple incorrect options require students to apply perimeter reasoning repeatedly, not just once.  
• Any single-response format would under-assess mastery (one click = one polygon).  Free-response or multiple blanks would be cumbersome and would not capture the “all-that-apply” reasoning demanded by the blueprint scenario.",#REF!

## Prerequisite skills  
• Fluently multiply and divide within 100.  
• Fluently add and subtract within 100.  
• Recognize and name squares and rectangles.  
• Understand that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length.  
• Understand that all four sides of a square are equal in length.  
• Read and comprehend one-step word problems.  
• Know that “area” counts square units inside a shape and “perimeter” counts the distance around a shape.  
• Write answers with the correct unit label (units, square units).  

## Microskills  
• Locate and circle the numbers in a word problem.  
• Decide whether the problem is asking for area, perimeter, or a missing side.  
• Identify whether the shape is a square or a rectangle.  
• For area: choose multiplication; for perimeter: choose addition/multiplication.  
• For squares: use “one side × one side” for area or “side × 4” for perimeter.  
• For rectangles: use “length × width” for area or “(length + width) × 2” for perimeter.  
• Isolate the unknown side when only one side and the total area or perimeter are given.  
• Use inverse operations (division or subtraction) to find a missing side length.  
• Attach the correct unit (“units” or “square units”) to the numerical answer.  
• Check whether the answer is reasonable (e.g., side lengths are whole numbers, no side longer than the perimeter, etc.).

Question: Rectangle J has side lengths 4 units by 8 units.
Which set of side lengths forms a different rectangle with the same perimeter as Rectangle J?
A. 6 units by 6 units
B. 5 units by 5 units
C. 7 units by 4 units
D. 9 units by 2 units

Answer: A
Answer Explanation:
Rectangle J’s perimeter is 2 × (4 + 8) = 24 units.
6 × 6: Perimeter 2 × (6 + 6) = 24 units ✔ (area changes to 36).
5 × 5: Perimeter 20 units ✘
7 × 4: Perimeter 22 units ✘
9 × 2: Perimeter 22 units ✘
Only the 6 units by 6 units rectangle keeps the perimeter at 24 while giving a different area, so option A is correct.

Question Type: MCQ  
Question: 
A rectangle is shown below.
<<Description: A rectangle has side lengths 6 units and 6 units.>>  
Which set of side lengths creates a rectangle with the same perimeter, but a different area?
Options:
- 7 units and 5 units
- 8 units and 4 units
- 3 units and 9 units
- All of the above

Answer: All of the above

Answer Explanation:
First, calculate the perimeter and area for the original rectangle:
- Side lengths: 6 units and 6 units (a square)
  - Perimeter = \(2 \times (6 + 6) = 2 \times 12 = 24\) units
  - Area = \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square units

Now check each option:

- 7 units and 5 units:
  - Perimeter = \(2 \times (7 + 5) = 2 \times 12 = 24\) units
  - Area = \(7 \times 5 = 35\) square units

- 8 units and 4 units:
  - Perimeter = \(2 \times (8 + 4) = 2 \times 12 = 24\) units
  - Area = \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square units

- 3 units and 9 units:
  - Perimeter = \(2 \times (3 + 9) = 2 \times 12 = 24\) units
  - Area = \(3 \times 9 = 27\) square units

Each listed rectangle has the same perimeter as the original square, but their areas are different (35, 32, and 27 square units, all less than 36). Therefore, the answer is ""All of the above."" 

To solve, use the formula for perimeter (\(2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\)) and area (\(\text{length} \times \text{width}\)) for each rectangle. Compare the perimeters to confirm they are the same, then compare the areas to check that they are different.","Worked Example #1  
Question: Ellen is comparing two rectangles.  
• Rectangle P is 5 inches long and 1 inch wide.  
• Rectangle Q is 4 inches long and 2 inches wide.  
Which statement correctly compares the areas and perimeters of the rectangles?  
A. The rectangles have equal areas, and rectangle P has a greater perimeter.  
B. The rectangles have equal areas, and rectangle Q has a greater perimeter.  
C. The rectangles have equal perimeters, and rectangle P has a greater area.  
D. The rectangles have equal perimeters, and rectangle Q has a greater area.

STEP 1: Use the area formula A = length × width to find Rectangle P’s area → 5 × 1 = 5 in²  
STEP 2: Use the same formula to find Rectangle Q’s area → 4 × 2 = 8 in²  
STEP 3: Compare the areas → 8 in² > 5 in², so Rectangle Q has the greater area.  
STEP 4: Apply the perimeter formula P = 2 (length + width) to Rectangle P → 2 (5 + 1) = 12 in  
STEP 5: Apply the same formula to Rectangle Q → 2 (4 + 2) = 12 in  
STEP 6: Compare the perimeters → 12 in = 12 in; the perimeters are equal.  
STEP 7: Select the statement that matches “equal perimeters and Rectangle Q has the greater area.”

Answer: A","MCQ, Drag and Drop, Multiselect, Graphing","1. Perimeter Pals Sorter  – easy  
Drag-and-drop action: Six small “rectangle cards,” each printed with its side-length pair, sit in a loose pile. A target card (5 × 3) is pinned on the left. Two drop trays are on the right:  
A) “Same perimeter, different area” B) “Not a match.”  
The student must drag every card into the correct tray. At least three cards have P = 16 but areas of 12, 14, or 15; the others do not. Because the task requires simultaneously evaluating several cards and classifying each one, it cannot be reduced to a single MCQ or a couple of fill-ins without losing the many-to-one matching nuance.

2. Area-Match Gallery  – medium  
Setup: A museum wall has three empty picture frames labeled “Frame 1,” “Frame 2,” and “Frame 3.” A placard states, “Each frame must hold a rectangle with area 24 sq units, but no two frames may have the same perimeter.” Eight rectangle cards (e.g., 2 × 12, 3 × 8, 4 × 6, 1 × 24, etc.) lie on a shelf. The student drags any three that satisfy the rule into the frames. Multiple correct combinations exist; grading is rule-based, not key-based, which MCQ cannot capture efficiently.

3. Perimeter Ladder Ranking  – hard  
All five rectangle cards displayed already share area 20 sq units. A vertical “ladder” has rungs numbered 1 (smallest perimeter) to 5 (largest perimeter). The learner drags each card onto a rung to order the rectangles by perimeter without ties. This ranking-by-drag gains its power from allowing any of 120 permutations; turning that into MCQ would need dozens of separate items and still not assess ordinal understanding as cleanly.

4. Build-a-Pair Workbench  – hard  
Two blank canvases, A and B, are on screen. Above them sits a bank of side-length tiles labeled 1 unit through 9 units. Rule panel:  
• “Both rectangles must have a perimeter of 22 units.”  
• “Rectangle B must have a different area than Rectangle A.”  
Students drag one length tile onto each side of Canvas A and Canvas B (the interface automatically mirrors opposite sides). The item scores correct when each canvas obeys P = 22 and areas differ. The constructive freedom (any allowable pair such as 5 × 6 vs 4 × 7) can’t be replicated by fixed-option MCQ or a single text entry.","1. Same-Perimeter “Quick Picks” – easy  
Prompt: One “anchor” rectangle is shown (e.g., 4 × 8).  Six other rectangles (given as pictures and/or length × width labels) sit in a tile bank: 1 × 11, 2 × 10, 3 × 9, 4 × 8, 5 × 7, 6 × 6.  Students must Select ALL rectangles that have the SAME perimeter as the anchor but a DIFFERENT area.  
Why multiselect is indispensable: more than one rectangle meets both conditions; students must recognize every correct choice and leave every incorrect choice.  A single-answer MCQ or a numeric entry cannot capture partial or over-selection errors, so the item would lose its diagnostic power.

2. Grid-Hunt for Equal Areas – medium  
Prompt: An anchor rectangle covering 24 squares (6 × 4) is drawn on a grid.  Eight other grid rectangles (3 × 8, 2 × 12, 1 × 24, 4 × 6, 6 × 4, 5 × 5, 8 × 4, 3 × 7) are displayed.  Students Select ALL rectangles that have the SAME area (24 sq units) but a DIFFERENT perimeter from the anchor.  
Why multiselect is indispensable: Several correct choices exist; credit hinges on identifying the complete set.  Neither a single MC choice nor a single area/perimeter entry could assess the “all-that-apply” reasoning required.

3. “Which Statements Are True?” Analysis – hard  
Setup: Four rectangles (A: 3 × 10, B: 5 × 8, C: 6 × 7, D: 4 × 11) are shown.  Six statements are listed; e.g.  
▢ A and B have the same perimeter but different areas.  
▢ A and C have the same area but different perimeters.  
▢ B and D have the same perimeter but different areas.  
▢ A and D have the same area and the same perimeter.  
▢ C and D have the same area but different perimeters.  
▢ B and C have the same perimeter but different areas.  
Students Select ALL true statements.  
Why multiselect is indispensable: Multiple truths exist and the distractors require nuanced comparison of every pair.  No single-response format can evaluate simultaneous understanding of several relationships.

4. Fixed-Area / Perimeter-Threshold Filter – hard  
Prompt: “A garden must cover exactly 32 square units but have a perimeter greater than 26 units.  Select ALL sets of whole-number side lengths that meet BOTH rules.”  Ten dimension cards are offered: 1 × 32, 2 × 16, 3 × 12, 4 × 8, 5 × 7, 6 × 6, 8 × 4, 16 × 2, 32 × 1, 9 × 5.  (Correct answers: 1 × 32, 2 × 16, 3 × 12.)  
Why multiselect is indispensable: More than one card satisfies the double condition, and students must choose the entire set while omitting close non-examples.  MCQ or fill-in-the-blank can neither present nor score this “filter-all-that-apply” task with equal fidelity.

• Count the pairs of parallel sides in a shape.

Opposite Sides  
If a shape has four sides, then two sides are opposite if they do not share a vertex (corner).

<<A quadrilateral with the top and bottom sides highlighted, labeled 'Opposite.' Next to it, another quadrilateral with two sides that touch at a corner highlighted, labeled 'Not opposite.'>>

When Opposite Sides are Parallel  
Two sides of a shape are parallel if they go the same direction and never cross, even if you keep extending them.

<<A colorful illustration showing two sets of train tracks running horizontally across the image, perfectly parallel to each other, with a bright blue sky background and green grass. The tracks are brown wooden ties with silver rails, and small arrows point along each track to show they go in the same direction.>>

<<Two diagrams showing pairs of parallel lines, one with a single pair of parallel orange lines and one with two pairs of parallel green lines, to illustrate how to identify parallel sides in quadrilaterals.>>

Counting Pairs of Parallel Sides  
When you find two sides that are parallel, they make one **pair**.
A quadrilateral can have 0, 1, or 2 pairs of parallel sides.  
Count each pair only once.

## Prerequisite skills  
• Recognize and name common 2-D shapes (triangle, square, rectangle, rhombus, trapezoid, parallelogram, kite).  
• Count sides and corners (vertices) of a polygon.  
• Understand that a side is a straight segment that connects two corners.  
• Read simple visual markings: tick marks for equal length, arrow marks for parallel sides, and square-corner marks for right angles.  
• Use positional language (top, bottom, left, right) and judge whether two line segments run in the same direction on grid or dot paper.  

## Microskills  
• Identify the four sides of any quadrilateral and label them mentally or with letters.  
• Recognize when two sides run in the same direction (parallel) by:  
  – Comparing horizontal sides to other horizontal sides.  
  – Comparing vertical sides to other vertical sides.  
  – Using arrow symbols drawn on sides.  
• Match each side with its opposite side.  
• Decide if opposite sides are parallel (yes/no).  
• Count up to two possible parallel-side pairs and avoid double-counting the same pair.    
• State the final count as 0, 1, or 2 pairs of parallel sides.  

## Precise Vocabulary  
quadrilateral – a 4-sided polygon  
side – one straight edge of a shape  
vertex (corner) – the point where two sides meet  
parallel sides – two sides that run in the same direction and never meet  
pair – two things that are matched together  
parallel-side pair – two sides of a quadrilateral that are parallel to each other  
right angle (square corner) – an angle marked with a small square  
rectangle – a quadrilateral with four right angles

### What is a Right Angle

A **right angle** is a special corner angle that looks like the corner of a square. It has a small square symbol in the corner. The square shows that the angle is a **right angle**.

<<Three right angles, horizontally aligned, each with a small square indicating the right angle.>>

**Quick Check:** Which of the following forms a **right angle**?
A. The corner of a book page.  
B. The rim of a cup.

**Click to see answer:**
The answer is A. The rim of a cup is round, but the corner of a normal book page is a **right angle**.

### Comparing Angles to Right Angles

When you see any angle, you can compare it to a **right angle**.  
Some angles are **less than a right angle**.  
Some angles are equal to a **right angle**.  
Some angles are **greater than a right angle**.

## 2. LEARNING CONTENT

### Writing Time with a Colon

When we write time using numbers, we put the hour first, then a colon, then the minutes. The colon is the two dots that separate hours and minutes.

<<Visual: A digital display showing ""4:25"" in large, bright green numbers on a black background. The colon should be clearly visible between the 4 and 25. Below the digital display, show labels pointing to each part: ""Hour"" pointing to 4, ""Colon"" pointing to the :, and ""Minutes"" pointing to 25.>>

### Special Time Words

Quarter past means 15 minutes after the hour. Half past means 30 minutes after the hour. Quarter til (short for ""a quarter until"") means 15 minutes before the next hour, which is the same as 45 minutes after the current hour.

**Quick Check:** If it is 2:30, which special time word describes this time?
**Click to see answer:** Half past 2, because 30 minutes after the hour is called half past.

STEP 4: Write the minutes as two digits (add a 0 in front if the number is less than 10).  
STEP 5: Place a colon between the hour and minute numbers to show the full time.","Instructional Approach  

## Prerequisite skills  
• Read and write numbers 1–59.  
• Skip-count by 5s to 60.  
• Recognize the positions of the numbers 1–12 on a clock face.  
• Distinguish between longer and shorter lengths.  
• Understand that a colon separates hours and minutes in written time (e.g., 3:45).

## Microskills  
• Identify the hour hand and describe its movement between two numbers.  
• Identify the minute hand and locate its exact position on the minute marks.  
• Decide which hour number the hour hand has most recently passed.  
• Convert the minute hand’s position to a minute value by:  
  – Counting by 5s for each numbered mark.  
  – Counting on by 1s for any extra minute marks past a 5-minute interval.  
• Write minutes as two digits, inserting a leading zero when needed (e.g., 3:07).  
• Place a colon correctly between the hour and minute numbers.  
• Match a written digital time to its corresponding analog clock and vice-versa.  
• Check for reasonableness (e.g., minute value does not exceed 59).

## Precise Vocabulary  
hour hand – the shorter hand that shows the hour and moves slowly from one number to the next.  
minute hand – the longer hand that shows the minutes and moves all the way around the clock each hour.

# Understanding Arithmetic Patterns

An **arithmetic pattern** is a sequence of numbers that follows the same rule over and over. The rule might be adding the same number, subtracting the same number, or multiplying by the same number each time.

**Quick Check:** Look at this sequence: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15. What operation and number creates this pattern?  
**Click to see answer:** Adding 3 each time (or multiplying by 3: 1×3, 2×3, 3×3, 4×3, 5×3)

# Addition Patterns and Properties

When you add an **even number** to any number, it stays odd or even — if it was even, it stays even, and if it was odd, it stays odd.  
When you add an **odd number** to any number, it changes — if it was even, it becomes odd, and if it was odd, it becomes even.

<<Chart showing sums of even and odd numbers>>

# Multiplication Patterns and Properties

When you multiply any number by an **even number**, the result is always even. When you multiply two **odd numbers** together, the result is always odd. When you multiply an even number by an odd number, the result is always even.

<<Multiplication table of 1 to 5 with even results in blue, odd results in red>>
