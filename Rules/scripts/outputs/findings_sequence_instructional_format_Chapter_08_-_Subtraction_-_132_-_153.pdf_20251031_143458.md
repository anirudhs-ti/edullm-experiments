### Sequence

The instructional sequence for subtraction is a structured progression of problem types, moving from simple concepts to more complex applications [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1, 3]. This sequence is divided into two main stages: a beginning stage for introducing the concept and an advanced stage for multi-digit computation [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1].

**Stages of Instruction**

*   **Beginning Stage:** This stage introduces the concept of subtraction [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1]. Instruction begins with simple problems where a single-digit number is subtracted from a single-digit minuend (e.g., 9 - 6) [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1]. The strategy at this stage involves using semi-concrete objects, such as lines, to represent the numbers in the problem [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1, 3]. Subtraction should be introduced after students have mastered the regular addition strategy [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 3]. Once the initial concept is taught, problems with a missing subtrahend (e.g., 7 — □ = 3) can be presented, keeping all numerals below 10 [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Advanced Stage:** In this stage, students learn multi-digit subtraction and are expected to compute basic facts mentally, without semi-concrete prompts [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1]. Basic subtraction facts are the 90 combinations where a one-digit number is subtracted from a one- or two-digit minuend, resulting in a one-digit difference [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1].

**Sequence of Problem Types**

The sequence progresses from easier to more difficult problem types, particularly in the multi-digit stage [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1, 3]. A detailed list of problem types and their suggested order of introduction is provided in the "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 2, 3].

1.  **No Renaming:** The easiest type of column subtraction is problems where renaming is not required because the subtrahend is smaller than the minuend in each column [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1]. These are introduced after students have memorized approximately 12 subtraction facts [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 6].
2.  **Renaming from One Column:** The next type involves problems where one or more columns have a subtrahend larger than the minuend, requiring renaming [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 3]. This is typically introduced in late first grade [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 6].
3.  **Complex Renaming:** The sequence then moves to more complex problems, including those with zeros in the minuend (e.g., 306 - 216) and those requiring renaming in consecutive columns (e.g., 421 - 247) [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 3].
4.  **Grade-Level Progression:** The Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart outlines a progression from Kindergarten to Grade 4, starting with conceptual introduction (K-1), moving to renaming from tens and hundreds (Grade 2), then problems with zeros and renaming from thousands (Grade 3), and finally problems with multiple zeros and five- to six-digit numbers (Grade 4) [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 2].

**Preskills and Discrimination Practice**

The sequence also dictates when to teach necessary preskills and how to structure practice.

*   **Preskills:** Before a new problem type is introduced, prerequisite skills are taught [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7, 9]. For example, before teaching renaming with a zero in the tens column (e.g., 407 - 129), students first learn "tens-numbers-minus-one facts" (e.g., 60 - 1) [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 9]. Similarly, "hundreds-minus-one facts" are taught as a preskill for problems with zeros in the tens and hundreds columns [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 10].
*   **Mixing Problem Types:** A critical part of the sequence is mixing different problem types on worksheets to ensure students learn to discriminate which strategy to use [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7, 8]. When renaming is first introduced, worksheets should include an equal mix of problems that do and do not require renaming [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7]. As more complex types are taught, worksheets should include a mix of the new problem type, previously introduced types, and addition problems [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 8]. This mixing is "very important" to prevent students from developing misrules, such as always renaming when they see a zero [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 9].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a structured procedure for teaching a specific skill or concept, often presented as a multi-part lesson plan with explicit teacher wording and activities [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 15-22]. Formats typically progress from highly structured, teacher-led demonstrations to less structured, independent student practice [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7, 9].

**Structure and Components**

Instructional formats are divided into distinct parts, each with a specific purpose:

*   **Structured Board Presentation:** The format often begins with the teacher demonstrating a skill or strategy on the board [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 9]. For example, in Format 8.3, Part C, the teacher models the entire strategy for subtraction with renaming [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 19].
*   **Structured Worksheet (Guided Practice):** Following the demonstration, the teacher leads students through problems on a worksheet, guiding them through each step [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7, 9]. In Format 8.5, Part B, the teacher guides students through solving problems that require renaming with zeros [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 22].
*   **Less Structured Worksheet (Independent Practice):** This is described as a "critical part of the format" where students work on a mix of problem types under supervision [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4]. Practice continues until students achieve 80% to 90% accuracy [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7]. Format 8.1, Part D, provides a worksheet with an equal mix of addition and subtraction problems for discrimination practice [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 16].

**Key Features**

*   **Explicit Teacher Wording:** Formats provide specific scripts for teachers to use, including questions, statements, and rules [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 15-22]. For instance, Format 8.3 introduces the rule: "When we take away more than we start with, we must rename" [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 17]. Vocabulary is chosen intentionally; for example, "minus" is used as a verb to help students grasp the concept without the "additional demand of new vocabulary" [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Focus on Preskills and Concepts:** Some formats are designed to teach a specific preskill before introducing a more complex strategy [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 9]. Format 8.4, for example, teaches the "tens-numbers-minus-one" preskill [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 21]. Other formats focus on conceptual understanding, such as Format 8.2, which uses a story and diagrams to teach the concept of regrouping before students learn the mechanics of renaming with numerals [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7, 17].
*   **Correction Procedures:** Formats include specific procedures for correcting student errors [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7, 15]. For a rule application error, the teacher stops the student, reminds them of the rule, has them repeat it, and then asks guiding questions to help them apply it correctly [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7].
*   **Systematic Example Selection:** The choice of problems within a format is critical [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7]. The less structured parts of formats must include an "unpredictable mix of problems" to provide practice in discriminating when to use different strategies [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7]. For example, after teaching renaming from the hundreds, a worksheet should include problems that require renaming from hundreds, renaming from tens, no renaming, and addition [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 8].
