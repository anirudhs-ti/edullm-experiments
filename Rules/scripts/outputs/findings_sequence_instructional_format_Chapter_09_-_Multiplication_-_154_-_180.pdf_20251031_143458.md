### Sequence

The instructional sequence for multiplication is divided into two main stages: a beginning stage and an advanced stage [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1]. The sequence follows a skill hierarchy, introducing concepts and problem types in a specific order based on grade level and complexity, and requires the mastery of prerequisite skills before moving to the next level [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, pp. 1-3].

**Beginning Stage (Typically Second Grade)**

*   **Objective:** To establish a conceptual understanding of multiplication [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Prerequisite Skills:** Students should master at least three skip-counting series before multiplication is introduced [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1]. The text suggests skip-counting by tens, twos, and fives in Kindergarten and first grade, followed by nines, fours, twenty-fives, sevens, threes, eights, and sixes in second grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Problem Type Sequence:**
    1.  **Single-Digit Multiplication:** This is introduced after students have mastered three count-by series and can read/write numerals 1-99, typically in third grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 4]. Problems are introduced in an order that coordinates with the skip-counting series students have mastered [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5].
    2.  **Missing-Factor Multiplication:** Problems like `5 × □ = 15` are introduced after students have mastered regular single-digit multiplication [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 6]. A timeframe of at least 3 to 4 weeks between the introduction of regular and missing-factor problems is recommended [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 6].

**Advanced Stage (Typically Begins in Third Grade)**

*   **Objective:** To teach students to work multi-digit problems using mental computation rather than concrete representations [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Prerequisite Skills:**
    *   Knowledge of basic multiplication facts [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 2].
    *   Renaming and complex addition facts (e.g., 72 + 4) [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 2].
    *   Expanded notation (e.g., understanding 34 as 30 and 4) [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 2].
    *   Column addition with renaming is a preskill for problems with two multi-digit factors [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 11].
*   **Problem Type Sequence:**
    1.  **One-Digit Factor times Two-Digit Factor (No Renaming):** Problems like `32 × 3` where the first product is less than 10 are introduced first [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 2, 10]. This type is typically taught in third grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3].
    2.  **One-Digit Factor times Two-Digit Factor (With Renaming):** Problems like `32 × 7` are introduced several days after problems without renaming [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 2, 10]. This is also a third-grade level problem [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3].
    3.  **Horizontally Written Problems (One-Digit times Multi-Digit):** Problems like `5 × 35 =` are introduced after students can solve vertically aligned problems [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 10]. This is typically a fourth-grade skill [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3].
    4.  **One-Digit Factor times Three-Digit Factor:** These problems (e.g., `758 × 2`) are introduced in fourth grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3, 11].
    5.  **One-Digit Factor times Three-Digit Factor (Zero in Tens Column):** A special problem type like `405 × 3` is introduced shortly after other three-digit factor problems [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3, 11].
    6.  **Two-Digit Factor times Two-Digit Factor:** Problems like `37 × 25` are usually introduced during mid-fourth grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3, 11].
    7.  **Two-Digit Factor times Three-Digit Factor:** This type is introduced during late fourth grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3, 11].
    8.  **Three-Digit Factor times Three-Digit Factor:** This is the last type mentioned and is presented during fifth grade [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3, 11]. This includes problems with a zero in the tens column of the multiplier, such as `382 × 506` [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 3].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a structured, multi-part teaching procedure designed to introduce a specific multiplication skill. The formats detailed in the text follow a consistent pattern of explicit instruction, moving from teacher modeling and demonstration to guided practice and finally to less structured, independent student work [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, pp. 4-6, 10, 12, 17-27].

**Common Components of an Instructional Format:**

*   **Conceptual Introduction/Demonstration:** Formats often begin by establishing conceptual understanding. For single-digit multiplication, this involves a "Pictorial Demonstration" (Part A of Format 9.1) using illustrations of equivalent sets to show students they can find a total a "fast way" [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 4, 17-18]. For multi-digit multiplication, this may involve breaking the problem into parts based on place value (e.g., `5 × 47` is broken into `5 × 7` ones and `5 × 4` tens) [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 10, 22].
*   **Translating the Problem:** A key step is teaching students how to read and interpret the problem. In Format 9.1, students learn to translate the multiplication sign (×) as "count by," so `5 × 2` is read as "count by 5 two times" [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 18]. For missing-factor problems, `5 × □ = 20` is translated as "Count by 5 how many times to end with 20?" [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 20].
*   **Structured Board Presentation:** This part involves the teacher modeling the strategy and guiding students through several examples on the board [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 10, 12]. The teacher models the physical actions, such as holding up fingers for skip counting, and provides explicit instructions for each step of the algorithm [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 19]. For example, in Format 9.4, the teacher models the precise order of operations for multiplying two two-digit numbers and explicitly states the rule for placing a zero in the ones column when multiplying by tens [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 12, 25].
*   **Structured Worksheet:** Following the board presentation, students work on problems from a worksheet with direct teacher guidance [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 6, 10, 12]. The teacher leads students through the initial steps of a problem, such as identifying the skip-counting number or determining what numbers to multiply first, before students complete it [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 19-20]. The use of tools like a place value grid or graph paper may be incorporated to help students align numerals correctly [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 10, 11-12].
*   **Less Structured Worksheet:** This is the final part of the format, where students work a set of problems on their own while the teacher monitors their performance [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5]. These worksheets often include a mix of problem types (e.g., multiplication and addition, or regular and missing-factor multiplication) to ensure students are attending to the signs and discriminating between strategies [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5, 6, 11, 12, 20, 22, 23-24, 27].
