### Sequence

The instructional sequence for addition is divided into two primary stages: the beginning stage and the multi-digit (or advanced) stage [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1]. The progression of skills is systematic, with mastery of preskills required before new concepts are introduced [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1, 4, 9]. A recommended instructional and assessment sequence is provided in a chart that organizes problem types by grade level, from Kindergarten to Grade 3 [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2].

**Beginning Stage Sequence:**
This stage focuses on establishing a conceptual understanding of addition, typically using semi-concrete representations [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1].
1.  **Preskills:** Before addition is taught, students must master preskills such as counting, numeral identification, and the principle of equality [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1]. The concept of equality is taught first, using a functional definition and examples [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 3].
2.  **Addition the Slow Way:** The first problem-solving strategy taught is "addition the slow way," where students draw lines to represent each addend and then count all the lines to find the sum [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4].
3.  **Missing Addends:** After students demonstrate mastery of beginning addition, problems with missing addends (e.g., 4 + â–¡ = 7) are introduced to enhance their understanding of the equality principle [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4, 5].
4.  **Addition the Fast Way:** Once students can solve both addition and missing addend problems, a transitional strategy called "addition the fast way" is introduced. In this method, students only draw lines for the second addend and begin counting from the first numeral [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4, 6].
5.  **Fact Memorization:** After students can work addition problems fluently, memorization of addition facts should begin [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 6].

**Multi-Digit (Advanced) Stage Sequence:**
This stage begins in first grade and requires mental computation rather than concrete representations [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1].
1.  **Preskill:** A necessary preskill for column addition is knowledge of basic addition facts [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 1].
2.  **Problems Not Requiring Renaming:** The first type of column addition problem introduced involves multi-digit numbers where the sum in each column is less than 10, so no renaming is needed (e.g., 36 + 13) [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2, 8].
3.  **Problems Requiring Renaming:** The next major type involves problems where the sum of one or more columns is greater than 10, requiring renaming (e.g., 36 + 15) [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2].
    *   A preskill for this is adding three single-digit numbers, which should be taught several weeks before renaming is introduced [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 9].
    *   The sequence begins with renaming from the ones to the tens column [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2, 10].
    *   As students learn to read and write larger numbers, problems that require renaming to the hundreds column are introduced, followed by problems that require renaming twice (from ones to tens and tens to hundreds) [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 10].
4.  **Three or More Addends:** The third major problem type involves adding three or more multi-digit numbers [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 3].
    *   A critical preskill for this is mastering "complex addition facts," which are problems where a single-digit number is mentally added to a two-digit number [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 3, 12]. Practice on these should begin after students know about 50 basic addition facts [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 12].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a structured procedure for teaching a specific skill or strategy, such as introducing equality (Format 7.1), teaching addition (Formats 7.2 and 7.4), or adding three numbers (Format 7.5) [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 3, 5, 9]. Formats are also used for reteaching when students demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of a strategy [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 8, 14].

**Structure and Progression:**
Instructional formats typically consist of several parts that guide students from highly structured, teacher-led instruction to more independent work [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 8].
*   **Structured Board Presentation:** The teacher begins by working a problem on the board, modeling the strategy and asking students questions to guide them through the steps [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 17, 24].
*   **Structured Worksheet Presentation:** Following the board presentation, the teacher leads students through a structured worksheet exercise, providing prompts for each step [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 19, 26].
*   **Less Structured Worksheet:** Finally, students work on a less structured worksheet where they apply the strategy more independently [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 20, 26]. Some formats may not require this part if the strategy involves relatively few steps [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 9].

**Key Features:**
*   **Explicit Scripting:** Formats provide specific wording for the teacher to use and detail the expected student responses, creating a clear script for instruction [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 17-27]. For example, Format 7.2 specifies that the teacher should say, "Listen to the equal rule: We must end with the same number on this side... and on the other side... of the equal sign" [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 18].
*   **Correction Procedures:** Formats include built-in procedures for correcting student errors. If a student hesitates or answers incorrectly, the teacher is instructed to model the correct answer, repeat the question, and have the student respond [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 10]. After a correction, the entire sequence of steps in the format is repeated to demonstrate how all the steps fit together [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5, 9]. Specific "To correct" notes are often embedded directly within the format's script [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 19, 21, 23].
*   **Purposeful Vocabulary:** The language used in formats is carefully selected to foster student understanding [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 10]. For instance, to reduce cognitive demand when introducing addition, the term "plus" is used as a verb before the formal term "addition" is introduced later [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Example Selection Guidelines:** The text provides criteria for selecting problems to use within a format. For "addition the slow way," sums should not exceed 10 [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5]. For adding three single-digit numbers, about half the examples should have 1 as the top numeral, as this mirrors renaming problems [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 9].
