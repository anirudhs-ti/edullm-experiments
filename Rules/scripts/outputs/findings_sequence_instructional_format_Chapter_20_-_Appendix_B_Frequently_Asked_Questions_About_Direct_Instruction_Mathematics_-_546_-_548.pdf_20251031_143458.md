# Sequence

A sequence, within the context of Direct Instruction mathematics, is exemplified by the counting sequence (e.g., 1 2 3 4 5) [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. The teaching of such a sequence is a component of the Direct Instruction approach [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. Learning a sequence like counting is considered an "inherently rote task" that requires "rote memorization" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. The decision to use rote instruction for a sequence is not an arbitrary choice by the instructional designer but is instead "driven by the demands of the task" itself [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].

# Instructional Format

An instructional format in a Direct Instruction approach is the structure used to deliver a lesson [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. These are described as "teaching formats that articulate instruction in a step-by-step fashion" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].

*   **Appearance and Perception**: Instructional formats can be "scripted," and their appearance can be misleading to critics [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. Some educators may confuse the "structure of the lesson with the content of the instructional strategy" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. Specifically, the more scripted a lesson's format is, "the stronger the perception that some form of rote instruction is being delivered" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Distinction from Content**: The format is presented as distinct from the instructional content it delivers [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. The text advises that despite the appearance of the format, "when teachers look closely at the content rather than the form of the lesson, they will find generalizable strategies" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. These strategies are designed to "promote conceptual understanding and develop reasoning skills" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
