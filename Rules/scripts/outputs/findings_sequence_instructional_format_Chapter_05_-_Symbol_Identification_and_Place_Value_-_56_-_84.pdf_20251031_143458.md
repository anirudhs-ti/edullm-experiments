### Sequence

The term 'sequence' refers to the specific and recommended order in which skills and concepts are introduced to students [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 1, 4]. The text provides an "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" that outlines a "recommended progression of skills" designed to integrate place value concepts with numeral reading and writing [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 1]. The foundation of this sequence is numeral identification and numeral/object correspondence [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 1].

Specific guidelines and examples for sequencing instruction are provided for various skills:

*   **Numeral Identification (0-10):** The sequence for introducing numerals is considered important [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
    *   A basic guideline is to separate numerals that look similar (like 6 and 9) or sound similar (like 4 and 5) by several lessons to avoid confusion [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
    *   One possible sequence that separates these pairs is 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 9, 10 [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
    *   A second guideline is to introduce new numerals cumulatively, meaning a new numeral is not presented until students have mastered the previously introduced ones [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Teen Numerals (Reading and Writing):** Instruction is sequenced to introduce regular teens (14, 16, 17, 18, 19) before irregular teens (11, 12, 13, 15) [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 9].
*   **Hundreds Numerals (Reading and Writing):** The sequence for introducing hundreds numerals is important [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 12].
    *   Numerals without a zero in the tens column are introduced first [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 12].
    *   More difficult examples with a zero in the tens column are introduced about a week later [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 12].
*   **Thousands Numerals (Reading and Writing):** A carefully designed sequence is recommended for introducing thousands numerals [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 13]. The recommended sequence is:
    1.  Numerals between 1,000 and 9,999 without zeros in the tens or hundreds column [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 13].
    2.  Numerals between 1,000 and 9,999 with zeros in the tens and/or hundreds column [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 13].
    3.  Numerals between 10,000 and 99,999 [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 13].
    4.  Numerals between 100,000 and 999,999 [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 13].
*   **Expanded Notation:** The sequence for introducing expanded notation problems parallels the sequence for teaching students to read and write numerals, progressing from teens to hundreds, then thousands, and finally millions [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 15].
*   **Column Alignment:** The complexity of column alignment tasks increases as the number of digits in the numerals increases [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 15]. The sequence begins with adding tens and ones numbers, then progresses to include hundreds, and later thousands [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 15].

### Instructional Format

An 'instructional format' refers to a structured teaching procedure used to present skills to students [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4, 7, 16-29]. These formats often consist of multiple parts that move from highly structured, teacher-led presentations to less structured, independent practice [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 9, 11].

Key components and characteristics of instructional formats include:

*   **Model-Lead-Test Procedures:** Many formats use a modeling and testing structure. For example, Format 5.1 for introducing new numerals consists of a "model" where the teacher names the numeral, a "test" where students identify it, and "discrimination practice" [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4]. A "model-lead-test-delayed test procedure" is described for teaching equation reading [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 7].
*   **Structured and Less Structured Presentations:** Formats are often divided into parts. Early parts involve a "structured board presentation" or "structured worksheet exercise" where the teacher provides prompts and guidance [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 9, 10, 19, 21, 23]. Later parts are "less structured" exercises where students perform the skill without prompting [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 9, 11, 19, 22, 25]. If students struggle with the less structured parts, it indicates they moved too quickly from the prompted task, and the teacher should return to the structured presentation [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 11].
*   **Alternating Pattern:** This pattern is used to help students remember new or difficult information. It involves presenting a new item, then one or more previously mastered items, before returning to the new item [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4]. This technique "is designed to help students better remember a new or difficult numeral" by gradually increasing the time they have to remember it [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4]. This pattern is used in numeral identification, numeral dictation, and error correction procedures [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4, 6].
*   **Discrimination Practice:** This is described as the "most important part" of introducing a new numeral [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4]. It involves asking students to identify a new numeral when it is mixed in with previously introduced numerals [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Use of Place Value Charts:** Formats for teaching place value concepts, such as reading and writing tens or hundreds numerals, utilize place value charts [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 3, 10, 11, 12]. These charts are used by the teacher to introduce concepts and by students during practice [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 3]. The charts are eventually eliminated once students demonstrate mastery [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 3, 10, 13].
*   **Error Correction:** Formats include specific procedures for correcting student errors. A common procedure is a "model-test-alternating pattern procedure," where the teacher shows the correct response, has the student copy it, and then alternates between the missed item and other items [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Preskills:** Some formats begin with parts dedicated to teaching preskills. For example, Format 5.6 (Writing Teen Numerals) starts with a preskill in Part A for teaching the component parts of a teen number [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 9, 20]. Format 5.8 (Writing Tens Numerals) includes preskills for expanded notation and tens facts [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 11, 23].
