### Sequence

A sequence refers to the recommended order for teaching skills within a specific pre-algebra topic [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 1]. The skills listed under each topic heading in the "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" are presented in the order they should be taught for that particular topic [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 2].

**Key Characteristics of Sequence:**

*   **Intra-Topic Order:** The sequence of skills *within* a topic is structured. For example, when teaching the coordinate system, the sequence is:
    1.  Students first find the x and y values for given points [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5].
    2.  After mastering this, they plot points on the coordinate system given the values [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5].
    3.  Next, they learn to complete a function table [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5].
    4.  Following this, they are taught to derive a function when given two pairs of values [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5].
    5.  Later, they learn to derive a function from points connected by lines on the coordinate system [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Inter-Topic Flexibility:** While the order within a topic is specified, the four major topics (Coordinate System and Functions; Other Types of Numbers; Expressions and Equations; Ratios and Proportions) can generally be taught in any order and may be taught simultaneously [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 2].
*   **Prerequisites:** There is an exception to inter-topic flexibility where one skill serves as a prerequisite for another [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 2]. Specifically, teaching positive and negative integers, which falls under "other types of numbers," is a necessary prerequisite for mastering algebraic equations [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 2, 6].
*   **Progression from Simple to Complex:** The instructional sequence is designed to build from simpler to more complex skills.
    *   **Equations:** Initial instruction focuses on single-step problems (e.g., 3 + x = 8). After students master that skill, they are taught to solve problems requiring more than one step (e.g., 4 + 5d = 12) [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 8-9]. Only after mastering single-variable problems are students ready for multiple variables and combining like terms [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9].
    *   **Integers:** When introducing the combination of positive and negative integers, students are initially given only addition problems to ensure only one new concept is introduced at a time [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 7].
    *   **Ratio Tables:** Students first master using simple ratio tables before being introduced to more sophisticated tables that involve fractions [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 12].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a document that outlines the specific procedures and strategies for teaching a skill [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 5, 7]. These formats are presented as a script-like guide with two columns: one labeled "TEACHER" containing instructions and questions, and another labeled "STUDENTS" containing the expected responses [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 20-35].

**Key Characteristics of Instructional Formats:**

*   **Structure and Components:** Formats are typically divided into multiple parts that guide instruction from teacher-led modeling to student independence [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9]. A complete format can include the following components:
    1.  **Preskill:** The format may begin by teaching a prerequisite skill necessary for the main lesson [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9]. For instance, Format 18.4 on solving equations with multiplication and division starts with "Part A: Preskill: Finding the Reciprocal" [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9, 27].
    2.  **Structured Board Presentation:** This is a highly guided section where the teacher introduces rules and models the procedure step-by-step [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9, 20, 22, 25]. In Format 18.3, the teacher uses this part to introduce the rule "Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other" and demonstrates how to isolate a variable [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9, 25].
    3.  **Less Structured Board Presentation:** This phase follows the initial modeling and provides guided practice [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9]. It often uses abbreviated rules to help students master the procedure before working independently [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 7, 23, 26].
    4.  **Structured Worksheet / Independent Practice:** The final part of the format provides opportunities for students to practice the skill on their own [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 9]. This can begin with a structured worksheet and progress to independent problem-solving [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 29.pdf, p. 21, 24, 27, 32].
*   **Teacher-Student Interaction:** The two-column layout explicitly details the dialogue and interaction between the teacher and students, making it a clear guide for lesson delivery [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 20-35]. The teacher's column contains the script, while the student's column provides the anticipated correct answers to the teacher's questions [Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 20-35].
