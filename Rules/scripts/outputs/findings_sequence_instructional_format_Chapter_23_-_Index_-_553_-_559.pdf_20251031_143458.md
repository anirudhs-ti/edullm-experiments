### Sequence

The provided text establishes 'sequence' as a foundational component of instructional design, referring to the deliberate ordering of skills and concepts for teaching [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]. The curriculum's structure relies on these sequences, which are formally outlined in an "instructional sequence and assessment chart" for numerous mathematical topics [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]. These charts exist for foundational skills like counting [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 1] and extend to more complex areas.

Specific applications of sequencing are detailed for various domains:
*   **Basic Facts:** There is a designated "sequence of facts" for teaching addition [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 1], subtraction [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 6], multiplication [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 4], and division [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 2].
*   **Instructional Language:** The text points to the existence of "sequencing guidelines" specifically for the language used in instruction [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Topical Progression:** The use of an "instructional sequence and assessment chart" is mentioned for a comprehensive list of topics, indicating that the instructional path for each is carefully sequenced. These topics include:
    *   Addition [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 1]
    *   Subtraction [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]
    *   Multiplication [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 4]
    *   Multi-digit division [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 4]
    *   Fractions [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]
    *   Decimals [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 2]
    *   Ratio, Probability, and Percent [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3, 5]
    *   Data Analysis [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 2]
    *   Geometry [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]
    *   Measurement, Money, and Time [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 3]
*   **Problem Types:** The term is also used to classify a specific type of problem, the "temporal sequence problems," which involve addition and subtraction [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 1, 6].

### Instructional Format

The provided text does not contain the phrase 'instructional format' [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 1-7]. The word "format" appears a single time in the index, in the entry "format, equivalent fractions, 299" [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 2]. This indicates that the source material discusses the format for equivalent fractions, but it does not provide a broader definition or detailed explanation of a general concept called 'instructional format' [Chapter 23 - Index - 553 - 559.pdf, p. 2].
