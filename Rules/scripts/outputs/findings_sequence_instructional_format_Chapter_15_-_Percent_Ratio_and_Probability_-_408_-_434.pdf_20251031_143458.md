### Sequence

The instructional sequence refers to the specified order in which skills are taught, which is organized to increase efficiency [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1]. This sequence is based on a hierarchy where mastery of foundational skills serves as a prerequisite for more advanced concepts [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1].

**General Sequence:**
*   Instruction in percent, ratio, and probability follows the teaching of basic fraction and decimal skills [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1]. These earlier skills are considered "preskills" [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1].
*   The recommended starting point for instruction in these topics is fifth grade [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1, 8].
*   Within this block of topics, percentage-related skills are recommended to be introduced before ratio and probability skills [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1].
*   The "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" provides a detailed sequence of problem types organized by grade level, starting in Grade 5 and progressing to Grade 6 [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1, 2].

**Sequence within Topics:**
*   **Percentage Problems:** Simple percentage problems are introduced first [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 4]. Complex percentage problems, which require an additional step of adding or subtracting, should only be introduced after students have practiced the simple problems for several weeks [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 4, 5]. Word problems are introduced after students can accurately calculate the corresponding computation problems [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Ratio Problems:** The skill of converting a fraction to a percent can be introduced several weeks after students have mastered simple percentage problems [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 5]. Within this skill, problems are sequenced by difficulty: initially, only fractions that convert to percentages without needing to be rounded off are used [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 6]. Problems that require rounding off should not be introduced for several weeks [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 6]. Simple ratio word problems are introduced once students have mastered converting fractions to a percent [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 7]. Complex ratio word problems are not introduced until students have had several weeks of practice with simple ratio problems [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 8].
*   **Probability Problems:** Experimental probability activities are recommended as an introduction to the concept of probability [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 9]. Probability word problems are introduced after students have mastered single-event probability, and compound probability problems can be included once that skill is learned [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 10].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a detailed, multi-part procedure for teaching a specific skill [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]. These formats, such as "Format 15.1" or "Format 15.2," often provide scripted dialogue for the teacher and list expected student responses [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 12-27]. The structure of these formats typically progresses from teacher-led demonstration to guided and then independent student practice.

**Common Components of an Instructional Format:**
*   **Structured Board Presentation:** This is a core component where the teacher demonstrates a new strategy or concept [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]. For example, in Format 15.1, the teacher demonstrates how to convert a percent to a decimal on the board [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3, 12]. In the case of a strategy error, remediation involves reteaching the entire strategy, beginning with the structured board part of the format [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 10].
*   **Structured Worksheet:** This part of the format provides students with guided practice [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3, 4, 6, 7]. These worksheets may contain prompts to help students through the steps of a new strategy [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 6]. For instance, a prompted problem for converting a fraction to a percent might look like: `_ / _ = .__ = __%` [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Less Structured Worksheet:** This component follows structured practice and allows students to work more independently as prompts are removed [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 6, 7, 17, 19, 22, 24].
*   **Introduction of Rules or Component Skills:** Some formats begin with a part dedicated to teaching a foundational rule or a smaller component skill. For example, Part A of Format 15.2 teaches students rules to determine if their answers to percentage problems are reasonable (e.g., if the percent is less than 100%, the answer is less than the number being multiplied) [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 4, 13].
*   **Example Selection Guidelines:** The formats emphasize the importance of careful example selection [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3]. This involves including a wide range of examples to provide students with the practice needed to generalize a strategy [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3]. For instance, when teaching percent-to-decimal conversion, examples should include percentages below 10%, between 10% and 100%, and over 100% [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3].
