### Sequence

The concept of sequence in geometry instruction refers to the specific order in which skills and concepts are introduced to students, often organized by grade level and built upon prerequisite knowledge [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 1, 8]. A suggested order for introducing skills is provided in the "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 8].

**Key Principles of Sequencing:**

*   **Grade-Level Progression:** The Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart outlines a progression of skills from Kindergarten through Grade 7 [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 2-7]. For example, students begin by identifying basic two-dimensional shapes like circles and squares in Kindergarten [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 2], move to calculating perimeter and area of rectangles in Grade 3 [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 3], learn to find the volume of a box in Grade 5 [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 5], and calculate the circumference and area of a circle in Grade 7 [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 6-7].
*   **Prerequisite Skills:** The sequence is structured so that foundational concepts are mastered before more advanced ones are introduced [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11]. The text states, "Generally, new information should not be introduced until students demonstrate mastery on previously introduced information" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11]. Specific examples of this principle include:
    *   Students must be "very comfortable with finding the area of both rectangles and triangles prior to being introduced to finding the area of complex figures" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12].
    *   An "important preskill for computing volume is multiplying three numbers" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 14].
    *   Facts about angles and lines, such as the number of degrees in a right angle or a full circle, "serve as prerequisite skills for more advanced problem solving in geometry" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 14].
    *   Students learn to solve one-step problems involving component angles before they "learn how to solve more complex problems" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 15].
    *   Before learning to find unknown angles in complex diagrams, "students need to be taught the concept of corresponding angles" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 15].
*   **Building Towards Advanced Topics:** The sequence is designed to build logic and skills that prepare students for future, more complex work, such as geometric proofs [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 16].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a structured procedure for teaching a specific geometric concept or skill, as demonstrated by the multiple examples labeled "Format 17.X" in the text [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11, 17-35]. These formats typically follow a pattern of gradually fading teacher guidance, moving from teacher modeling to independent student practice [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 13].

**Common Components of an Instructional Format:**

*   **Structured Board Presentation (Part A):** This is the initial teaching phase where the teacher takes the lead.
    *   The teacher models the definition or procedure [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
    *   Visual representations are used to promote conceptual understanding [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 8]. For instance, in teaching the area of a rectangle, the teacher illustrates how the figure can be divided into square units [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11, 18]. Similarly, when teaching the volume of a box, a visual representation shows how it can be divided into cubic units [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 14, 31].
    *   The teacher provides a rule or definition in "student-friendly language" [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
    *   The teacher demonstrates the application of the concept, such as computing the area of several rectangles [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12].
    *   The teacher tests students by asking them to apply the new information to examples and nonexamples [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
*   **Less Structured Board Presentation (Part B):** This phase follows the initial introduction and involves more student participation.
    *   The teacher reviews the equation or concept with the students [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12].
    *   Students apply the skill by identifying measurements and calculating answers for new problems presented on the board [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12, 19-20].
*   **Worksheet Exercises (Parts C & D):** These parts provide students with practice.
    *   The practice often begins with a "Structured Worksheet" where the teacher asks questions and provides prompts to guide students [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12, 20-21].
    *   This is followed by a "Less Structured Worksheet" with "fewer teacher prompts" or "minimal prompts," allowing students to work more independently [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 12]. This progression represents a gradual fading of teacher guidance [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 13].
    *   Worksheets for independent practice should contain two sections: one to test the new concept and another for "cumulative review" of previously taught concepts to prevent forgetting and provide discrimination practice [Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
