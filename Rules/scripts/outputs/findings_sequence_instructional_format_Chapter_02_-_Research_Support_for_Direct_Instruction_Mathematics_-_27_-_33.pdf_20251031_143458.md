### Sequence

The provided text does not define 'sequence' as a standalone instructional concept. However, it describes principles related to the sequencing of content and skills within the framework of direct and explicit instruction. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) are described as "a coherent and consistent sequence of standards that build to high-level achievement" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. The instructional approach supported by research in the text involves a careful sequence where content is broken down and built upon systematically.

Key elements that describe this instructional sequencing include:
*   **Presentation in Small Steps**: A core component of direct instruction is that "Content [is] presented in small steps" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. Research reviewed by Rosenshine and Stevens (1986) similarly recommends that teachers "Present new material in small steps, with student practice after each step" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. This approach ensures progress is achieved with "relative ease" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Gradual Introduction of New Skills**: Skills are not taught in isolation but are built upon previously learned material. Research recommendations from Brophy and Good (1986) state that new skills should be "gradually phased in while old ones are being mastered" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Mastery and Cumulative Review**: The sequence of instruction emphasizes mastery before moving on. Skills should be mastered to "overlearning" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. This is supported by the inclusion of "Independent practice including cumulative review" as a feature of direct instruction [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. The Institute for Educational Sciences (IES) also recommends "frequent cumulative review" as part of explicit and systematic instruction [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7].
*   **Logical Progression**: The process involves teachers demonstrating "step-by-step processes to solve problems," followed by the "application of the strategies to a specific set of problems," and finally the requirement that students "use a specific step-by-step protocol to solve problems" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7].

### Instructional Format

The text describes the format of effective mathematics instruction through research-based recommendations for "direct instruction," "explicit instruction," and "systematic teaching" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. This instructional format is characterized by a structured and teacher-led approach that includes explicit modeling, extensive practice, and systematic feedback.

Key components of this instructional format are:
*   **Explicit Teacher Modeling and Explanation**: The teacher's role is to provide clear and direct demonstrations. This is defined as "Explicit teacher modeling or explanation" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel (NMAP) recommends "Clear teacher modeling of problem types using an array of examples" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 6]. This involves giving "clear and detailed instructions and explanations" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4] and providing "models of proficient problem solving" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7]. This can also include the "verbalization of thought processes" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7] and teacher demonstrations of "step-by-step processes to solve problems" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7].
*   **Guided and Independent Student Practice**: After modeling, students are given extensive opportunities to practice. The format includes "Guided student practice with gradually faded support" and "Independent practice including cumulative review" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. Research recommends providing a "high level of active practice for all students" and guiding them "during initial practice" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. The NMAP and IES also emphasize "Extensive student practice of strategies and skills" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 6] and "guided practice" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7]. Students should also be given "opportunities to think aloud" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Systematic Feedback and Correction**: A critical part of the format is providing feedback to students. This includes the "Use of feedback including explicit corrections of errors" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3]. Students should "get clear feedback about the correctness of their responses" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. This feedback should be "systematic" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4] and "corrective" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7].
*   **High Student Engagement**: The format is designed to keep students actively involved. This is achieved by asking "a large number of questions, check[ing] student understanding, and obtain[ing] responses from all students" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. Commercially developed Direct Instruction (capital letters) programs include specific features to increase engagement, such as "unison student responding and signals to coordinate those responses" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Monitoring**: The instructional format includes close monitoring of student progress "so that all students, especially struggling students, are checked, receive feedback, and achieve mastery" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
