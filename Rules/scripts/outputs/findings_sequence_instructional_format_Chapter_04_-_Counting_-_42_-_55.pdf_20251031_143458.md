### Sequence

A sequence refers to an ordered series, which can be either a sequence of numbers used in counting or a sequence of skills to be taught [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1].

**Types of Sequences:**

*   **Number Sequence:** This is the ordered identification of number names, such as "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6" in rote counting [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1]. These sequences are fundamental to various counting skills:
    *   **Rote Counting:** The basic forward counting sequence [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1]. Teachers introduce new numbers by adding to the end of a known sequence (e.g., adding 12 and 13 after a student masters counting to 11) [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3].
    *   **Counting from Numbers Other Than One:** This involves starting a number sequence from a number other than one (e.g., "6, 7, 8, 9") [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1]. This skill helps focus on new parts of a number sequence without starting from the beginning [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 6].
    *   **Backward Counting:** This involves reciting a number sequence in reverse order, such as counting down from 5 to 0 [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 7].
    *   **Skip Counting (Count-by Series):** This is a sequence of multiples of a base number, such as counting by fives ("5, 10, 15, 20...") [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3]. The text refers to a skip-counting sequence as a "count-by series" [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 8].

*   **Instructional Sequence:** This is the recommended order in which different skills should be taught, often based on a hierarchy where one skill is a prerequisite for another [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1].
    *   An "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" outlines a recommended instructional sequence for counting skills like rote counting, rational counting, and skip counting [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1, 2].
    *   For example, rote counting is a prerequisite for and is taught before rational counting [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1].
    *   A specific instructional sequence is recommended for teaching skip-counting series (10, 2, 5, 9, 4, etc.) to separate series that contain many of the same numbers and thus reduce potential student confusion [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 8].

**Teaching and Correcting Sequences:**

*   When teaching a new part of a counting sequence, teachers model the new part, lead students in saying it, test them on the new part, and then have them recite the entire sequence from the beginning [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3, 4].
*   If a student makes an error in a sequence (e.g., skipping a number), the teacher should stop the student immediately, model the "hard part" (the numbers before and after the error), lead the student on the hard part, test them on it, and then have them start the sequence again from the beginning [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a structured, step-by-step teaching procedure designed to teach a specific skill [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3, 4, 6]. These formats are repeatable and are used until students demonstrate mastery [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3].

**Structure and Components:**

*   **Scripted Steps:** Formats are presented with specific wording for the teacher and expected responses from students, often in a two-column layout [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 10-14].
*   **Multiple Parts:** A format can be divided into parts, such as a "Structured Board Presentation" where the teacher demonstrates on the board, and a "Structured Worksheet Presentation" where students practice on their own papers [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 5, 11, 12].
*   **Teacher Actions and Signals:** Formats include explicit instructions for teacher actions, such as using signals to cue student responses. Examples include clapping at 1-second intervals for rational counting [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 5], dropping a hand to signal students to say a new part of a sequence [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 10], or moving a hand in a circular motion for the "get-it-going" signal [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Core Teaching Method:** Many formats are built on a "model-lead-test" procedure [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4, 9]. The teacher first models the skill, then leads the students through it, and finally tests their ability to perform it independently [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4]. A "delayed test" is often included to ensure students have retained the skill [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4].

**Implementation:**

*   **Prerequisites:** The introduction of a specific format is often tied to students' mastery of prerequisite skills. For instance, the format for rational counting is introduced only after students can rote count to about 10 [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 3]. Similarly, the format for counting from numbers other than one is introduced when students can rote count to about 15 [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Monitoring and Correction:** Formats emphasize the importance of monitoring student performance [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 5]. They also contain specific procedures for correcting student errors. For example, if a student makes a coordination error in rational counting, the teacher repeats the task after telling the student to "count only when touching an object" [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Adaptability:** Formats can be adapted or modified. The format for counting from 30 to 100 is described as being similar to the format for introducing early numbers, but with modifications like starting from a tens number instead of from one [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 7].
