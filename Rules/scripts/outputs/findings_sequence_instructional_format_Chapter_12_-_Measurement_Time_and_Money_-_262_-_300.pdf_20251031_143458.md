### Sequence

A sequence is the controlled and ordered manner in which skills and information are introduced to students [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8]. The text emphasizes that the sequence of instruction must be "carefully controlled" [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8, 13]. This involves several key principles:

*   **Teaching Systems Independently:** To prevent confusion, especially for lower-performing students, different measurement systems (customary and metric) should be taught independently and at different times of the year [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 6]. Students should be familiar with the common units of one system before the other is introduced [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Cumulative Introduction:** New information is introduced cumulatively, meaning a new skill is not taught until students have demonstrated mastery of prior, prerequisite skills [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8]. For example, when teaching coins, the penny and nickel are introduced first, and only after students can discriminate between them are dimes and then quarters introduced [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 20]. Similarly, conversion problems should not be taught until students have mastered the necessary equivalencies [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 11].
*   **Progression from Simple to Complex:** Instruction should begin with simpler concepts and gradually move to more complex ones.
    *   **Measurement:** In early grades, instruction is simple, focusing on common units and measuring to the nearest whole unit [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 6]. In later grades, it becomes more complex, introducing less common units, more sophisticated tool usage, and conversion problems [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 6]. When teaching how to use a ruler with fractions, a sequence of rulers is recommended, starting with halves, then fourths, then eighths, and finally sixteenths, with mastery required at each step before moving to the next [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 9].
    *   **Time:** Telling time is divided into two stages. First, students learn a strategy to express time as "minutes after the hour" [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 16]. Only after mastering this are alternate ways of telling time, such as "quarter past" or "minutes before the hour," introduced [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 16, 19].
    *   **Money:** When teaching how to count mixed coins, a two-step strategy sequence is recommended: first, grouping like coins, and second, starting with the highest-value coin to count [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 20].
*   **Structured Charts:** The "INSTRUCTIONAL SEQUENCE AND ASSESSMENT CHART" provides a concrete example of a sequence, outlining problem types and skills by grade level for measurement, time, and money [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 2-4]. For instance, it shows that determining the value of single coins is taught before determining the value of groups of different coins, and adding dollars and cents is taught before subtracting them from whole dollar figures [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 4].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a detailed, step-by-step procedure for teaching a specific skill or concept [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22]. These formats are highly structured and serve as a guide for teachers.

*   **Structure and Components:** Formats are typically divided into multiple parts (e.g., Part A, Part B) that break down a skill into manageable steps [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 12, 26-39]. They often feature a two-column layout with a "TEACHER" column providing an explicit script and a "STUDENTS" column showing the expected responses [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 26-39]. Some formats also include specific correction procedures to use when students make an error [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 27, 35].
*   **Instructional Progression:** The formats follow a clear progression from teacher-led instruction to guided and independent practice.
    1.  **Teaching Component Skills:** Formats often begin by teaching important component skills in isolation. For example, Format 12.2 on metric conversions first teaches students how to determine the relative size of units (Part A) and the correct operation (Part B) before combining these skills [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 12, 28]. Similarly, Format 12.6 on telling time first teaches how to determine the hour (Part A) and then the minutes (Part B) separately [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 32-33].
    2.  **Structured Board Presentation:** After component skills are taught, a format typically includes a "structured board presentation" where the teacher models how to combine the components into a complete strategy to solve a problem [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 12, 27, 29, 33, 36].
    3.  **Structured Worksheets:** Following the teacher's demonstration, formats guide students through practice using "structured worksheet" exercises [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 12, 27, 29, 34, 36]. These worksheets provide scaffolding as students apply the new strategy. Some formats also progress to "less structured worksheet" exercises to promote more independent application of the skill [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 34].
*   **Examples in the Text:** The chapter provides numerous examples of these formats, such as "Format 12.1: Metric Prefixes" [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 26], "Format 12.6: Expressing Time as Minutes After the Hour" [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 32], and "Format 12.11: Decimal Notation for Money" [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 39]. These formats outline the precise steps and wording for teachers to use when introducing, modeling, and providing practice on new skills.
