# Sequence

A sequence is a carefully planned order for introducing basic arithmetic facts to students to avoid confusion [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 2]. The text provides suggested sequences for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division facts, which are organized into lettered sets of three or four facts each [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5]. These sets are intended to be introduced in alphabetical order, starting with Set A, followed by B, C, and so on [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5]. Designing a coherent sequence for introducing facts is considered an essential component for building fact mastery [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8].

The construction of these sequences follows three specific guidelines [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5]:
1.  Easier facts are introduced first [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
2.  Related facts are introduced together [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
3.  The reverse of a specific series of facts is taught relatively soon after the initial series is presented [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].

The text also provides recommendations for sequencing the introduction of different operations [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
*   In most commercial programs, addition facts are introduced first, followed by subtraction, multiplication, and then division [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
*   It is recommended to introduce related subtraction or division facts for a particular set a month or more after the original addition or multiplication set has been introduced, as introducing them concurrently can cause difficulty for lower-performing students [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
*   A specific recommendation is to begin introducing subtraction facts after students have learned about half of their addition facts (e.g., after addition sets A through M), and then alternate between introducing new sets of addition and subtraction facts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
*   Multiplication facts are recommended to be introduced beginning in third grade, even if students have not fully mastered addition and subtraction [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].
*   For upper-elementary and middle school students who have not mastered basic addition and subtraction, it is recommended to present multiplication and division facts first before returning to addition and subtraction [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5].

# Instructional Format

An instructional format refers to a specific teaching procedure used to introduce new sets of facts, particularly through relationship activities designed to make memorization easier and more efficient [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 5, 6]. The text details three main types of formats used for relationship activities.

### Plus-One Facts (Format 6.1)
This format is designed to teach students a strategy for figuring out plus-one facts by applying the rule: "When you plus one, you say the next number" [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 6]. It is intended to be introduced in kindergarten [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 6]. The format consists of three parts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 16]:
*   **Part A: Next Number:** The teacher first teaches the term "next number" by saying a series of numbers and having students state the next one [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 16].
*   **Part B: Plus-One Rule with Stretch Prompt:** After students master Part A, the teacher introduces the plus-one rule, models it, and then tests students using a prompt where the first addend is stretched out to help students make the counting association (e.g., "sssiiixxx plus one") [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 16].
*   **Part C: Plus-One Rule without Prompt:** The teacher presents plus-one facts without any prompting, initially pausing for 2 to 3 seconds before signaling for a response to give students time to think [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 16].

### Series Saying (Format 6.2)
This is a major relationship activity that involves teaching students to say a consecutively ordered set of fact statements to help them notice the counting relationship among facts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7]. This format can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division facts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7]. It has four parts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 17]:
*   **Part A: Reading Statements:** Students read the consecutively ordered statements written on the board [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 17].
*   **Part B: Reading Statements with Answers Erased:** The teacher erases the answers, and students read the statements again, providing the answers [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 17].
*   **Part C: Saying Statements:** The teacher erases everything, and students must say the series from memory [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 17].
*   **Part D: Random Fact Drill:** The teacher writes the facts from the series in random, vertical order on the board without answers for students to practice [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 7, 17].

### Three-Number Fact Families (Formats 6.3 & 6.4)
This is another major format designed to demonstrate relationships among facts by using sets of three numbers from which students generate four related statements [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8].
*   **Format 6.3: Addition and Multiplication Facts:** This format teaches students to use the commutative properties of addition and multiplication [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8]. It has three parts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 18-19]:
    *   **Part A:** Students are taught to construct a pair of addition statements from a set of three numbers (e.g., from 2, 5, and 7, they construct 2 + 5 = 7 and 5 + 2 = 7) [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 18].
    *   **Part B:** Students are orally tested on the new "reversed" facts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 18].
    *   **Part C:** A worksheet exercise where students fill in the sum (the "big number") and generate two addition statements [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 18].
*   **Format 6.4: Subtraction and Division Facts:** This format is used to generate subtraction facts from addition facts and division facts from multiplication facts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8]. It has two parts [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 19-20]:
    *   **Part A:** The teacher demonstrates how three related numbers can generate two subtraction statements, introducing the rule: "When you subtract, you always start with the big number" [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 19].
    *   **Part B:** A worksheet exercise where students construct four statements (two addition and two subtraction) from three numbers [Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 8, 20].
