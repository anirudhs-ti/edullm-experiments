### Sequence

The instructional sequence for teaching division is organized into two primary stages: the beginning stage and the multi-digit division stage [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1]. A significant amount of time separates the introduction of these two stages to allow for the memorization of basic division facts [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1]. The specific problem types and the grade levels at which they are typically introduced are detailed in the "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1, 2].

**Beginning Stage Sequence:**
This stage, typically presented in mid-third grade, introduces the core concept of division [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1, 3]. The sequence of instruction is as follows:
1.  **Concrete Demonstrations:** The concept is first introduced using concrete objects or pictures to illustrate how a larger group can be divided into smaller, equal-sized groups [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1].
2.  **Problems Without Remainders:** Initial problems illustrate division with no remainder [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1]. This includes one-digit divisors and one-digit quotients [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 2].
3.  **Division Facts:** About a week or two after the concept is introduced, exercises are presented to facilitate mastery of basic division facts [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 4].
4.  **Problems With Remainders:** The concept of a remainder is introduced after students have learned approximately 20 division facts, specifically those with divisors of 2 and 5 [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 4].
5.  **Remainder Facts:** About a week after the remainder concept is introduced, students are taught to mentally compute division facts that have remainders [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 5]. The sequence for introducing these facts parallels the sequence for facts without remainders; for a given divisor, remainder facts are taught about two weeks after the basic facts for that divisor have been taught [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 5].

**Multi-Digit Stage Sequence:**
This stage, which begins around early fourth grade, teaches students the algorithms for solving division problems with multi-digit quotients [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1, 9]. The sequence is ordered by the number of digits in the divisor and the complexity of the quotient [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 9].
1.  **One-Digit Divisors:**
    *   **Two-Digit Quotients:** Problems with two-digit quotients are introduced first [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 10].
    *   **Zero in the Quotient:** Problems with a zero as the last digit of a two-digit quotient are introduced several weeks later [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 11].
    *   **Three-or-More-Digit Quotients:** These are introduced only after students have mastered problems with two-digit quotients [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 11].
    *   **Zero in Three-Digit Quotients:** Problems with a zero in the quotient are introduced after students can solve three-digit quotient problems without zeros. Problems with a zero as the second digit (e.g., in 103) are noted as being difficult for many students and are taught using a structured worksheet exercise [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 11].
2.  **Two-Digit Divisors:** These problems are substantially more difficult and are introduced later [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 1].
    *   **Preskill of Rounding:** Before two-digit divisor problems are introduced, students must master the skill of rounding numbers to the nearest tens unit [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 13].
    *   **Correct Estimated Quotients:** Initially, problems are limited to those where the estimation procedure yields a correct quotient [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 12, 13]. Problems with one-digit quotients are presented first, followed several days later by problems with two-digit quotients [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 13].
    *   **Incorrect Estimated Quotients:** Problems where the estimation yields a quotient that is too large or too small are introduced about a week after students have developed accuracy with problems where estimates are correct [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 12, 15].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format is a detailed, structured procedure for teaching a specific skill in division [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 19, 21, 23]. These formats are used to introduce new concepts, teach preskills, and provide remediation for common errors [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 7, 10, 13, 19]. The formats typically progress from high levels of teacher guidance to more independent student work.

**Common Structure and Components:**
Instructional formats often consist of several parts that follow a consistent pattern:
*   **Teacher Modeling and Demonstration:** Formats frequently begin with the teacher modeling a skill or concept on the board in a "Structured Board Presentation" [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 20, 23, 27, 30]. This involves the teacher demonstrating the entire process, explaining each step, and sometimes using physical or visual aids like drawing and circling lines [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 4, 20, 21].
*   **Guided Practice (Structured Worksheets):** Following the teacher's demonstration, students engage in guided practice, often through a "Structured Worksheet" [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 4, 10, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 34, 36]. During this phase, the teacher leads students through problems, asking questions and providing prompts to guide them through each step of the process [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 5, 22, 28].
*   **Independent Practice (Less Structured Worksheets):** The final part of a format is often a "Less Structured Worksheet," where students work through problems more independently while the teacher monitors their work [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 4, 10, 20, 22, 29, 35, 37].

**Specific Techniques within Formats:**
*   **Prescribed Wording:** Formats often specify the exact language the teacher should use. For example, a problem like `5)20` is read as "5 goes into 20 how many times?" to draw attention to the divisor and facilitate the use of multiplication facts [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 19].
*   **Breaking Down Skills:** Complex algorithms are broken down into smaller component skills, which are taught and practiced in separate parts of a format before being combined. For instance, Format 10.6 first teaches students how to determine which part of a multi-digit problem to work on before teaching the full algorithm [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 10, 26]. Similarly, Format 10.8 teaches the preskills of horizontal multiplication and estimation before integrating them into the full two-digit divisor strategy [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 13, 31-33].
*   **Specialized Materials:** Formats may utilize specially designed worksheets or visual aids. Format 10.2 uses worksheets with pre-drawn diagrams of lines and circles to help students focus on the mechanics of calculating a remainder [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 4-5, 22]. Format 10.8 introduces a box drawn next to the problem where students write the rounded-off version to help with estimation [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 14, 32].
*   **Remediation Formats:** Specific formats are designed to correct common errors. These formats teach students explicit rules, such as "If the remainder is too big, we make the answer bigger" or "If you can't subtract, make the answer smaller" [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 7, 15, 25, 26]. They often use worksheets where quotients are already written (some incorrectly) and students must check the work and make corrections [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 7, 15, 25, 36].
