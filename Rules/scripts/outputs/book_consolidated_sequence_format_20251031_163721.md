### What is a 'good' sequence? How to check it? What rules must be followed while creating a sequence? Are there specifics on what types of questions must be there?

A 'good' sequence is an instructional design feature that establishes the best possible order for introducing new information, skills, and strategies to students [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2]. It is a logical, hierarchical, and coherent order that directly impacts how difficult content is for students to learn [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2; Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3, 4; Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1].

To check if a sequence is good, one should evaluate the "scope and sequence" of the program to see if skills are presented in a logical order and if the content is integrated "within and across grade levels" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3, 5]. A "potential problem" that requires modification is when skills are "not presented in a logical sequence" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 7]. Many chapters provide an "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" that outlines a recommended progression of skills, which can serve as a benchmark [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1, 2; Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 1; Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2].

Several rules must be followed while creating a sequence:

*   **Teach preskills before the strategy.** Instruction must be sequenced so that necessary component skills, or preskills, are taught before the complete strategy is introduced [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 2].
    *   Example: Before teaching subtraction with regrouping across zeros (e.g., 3,002 – 89), a recommended preskill is teaching "hundreds-minus-one problems (300 – 1 = 299)" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: Students must master skip-counting series before multiplication is introduced [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Teach easy skills before more difficult ones.** Instruction should progress from simpler to more complex tasks [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: Students should be taught to add fractions with like denominators before being taught the more difficult skill of adding fractions with unlike denominators [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: In decimal multiplication, easier problem types are mastered before more confusing types, such as those requiring a zero in the answer (e.g., .4 x .2 = .08), are introduced [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 10].
*   **Separate confusing information or strategies.** The more similar two skills are, the more likely students are to confuse them, so their introduction should be separated by several lessons or a significant amount of time [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 22].
    *   Example: The numerals 6 and 9 should not be introduced consecutively because young students often confuse them [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. A possible sequence that separates them is 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 9, 10 [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
    *   Example: Converting mixed numerals to improper fractions should not be introduced until "several months later" than the reverse skill to "decrease the probability of students confusing the two operations" [Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 22].
*   **Present content in small, cumulative steps.** New material should be presented in small steps, with student practice after each step [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4]. New skills are gradually phased in and not presented until students have mastered the previously introduced ones [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Ensure mastery and include cumulative review.** Skills should be mastered to "overlearning," and instruction should include "frequent cumulative review" of previously taught concepts [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4, 7].
    *   Example: After the mode is introduced, an exercise should require students to compute the mean, median, and mode to review all previously learned concepts [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9].
*   **Mix problem types for discrimination practice.** It is "very important" to mix different problem types on worksheets to ensure students learn to discriminate which strategy to use [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7, 9].
    *   Example: When renaming is first introduced in subtraction, worksheets should include an equal mix of problems that do and do not require renaming [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7].
    *   Example: Addition and subtraction word problems are introduced together to "provide discrimination practice" [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].

There are specifics on the types of questions that must be included in a sequence. When teaching students to interpret graphs, a sequence of question types is recommended, progressing from simple to complex:
1.  **Literal Questions:** Ask for specific information found directly on the graph [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. Example: "How many points did Sarah score in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
2.  **Comparison Questions:** Introduced after literal questions are mastered, these require comparing two pieces of information [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. Example: "How many more points did Sarah score in January than in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
3.  **Inference Questions:** As the most difficult type, these are included only after students master the other two types [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. Example: "Why do you think Sarah scored more points in May than in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].

### What is a 'good' format? How to check it? What rules must be followed while creating a format? What language should be used?

A 'good' instructional format is a "teaching format or script" that translates explicit instructional strategies into specific, step-by-step teaching procedures [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. Good formats are designed to ensure teacher explanations are "clear and unambiguous" and consistent [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].

To check if a format is good, one should look at the content it delivers rather than just its scripted form [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. A good format presents a "generalizable strategy" that is of "intermediate generalizability—not too narrow or too broad" and promotes "conceptual understanding and develop reasoning skills" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
*   Example: "Format 13.3: Writing Numerical Fractions" is cited as an example of a format that provides a "generalizable strategy that promotes conceptual understanding of both proper and improper fractions" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5].

Several rules must be followed while creating a format:

*   **Provide explicit, scripted procedures.** Formats should provide "specific teacher wording, examples, and often error-correction procedures" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. They are often presented in a two-column layout with a "TEACHER" column providing an explicit script and a "STUDENTS" column showing expected responses [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 26-39; Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 20-35].
*   **Follow a gradual release of responsibility.** Formats should follow a "carefully designed instructional sequence" that reflects a "gradual release of responsibility from teacher to student" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. This typically involves a progression of four parts:
    1.  A structured board presentation (teacher modeling)
    2.  A structured worksheet presentation (guided practice)
    3.  A less structured worksheet presentation (independent practice)
    4.  Supervised practice
    [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5; Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7, 9].
*   **Use a model-lead-test procedure.** Many formats are built on a procedure where the teacher first models the skill, then leads students through it, and finally tests their ability to perform it independently [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4, 9; Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7]. A "delayed test" is often included to check for retention [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Incorporate frequent questioning and monitoring.** A key characteristic is the "use of frequent questioning" to continuously monitor student understanding and increase engagement [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. Teachers should check all students, especially struggling ones, to provide feedback and ensure mastery [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Include systematic feedback and error correction.** Formats must include the "Use of feedback including explicit corrections of errors" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: A common correction is a "model-test-alternating pattern procedure," where the teacher shows the correct response, has the student copy it, and then alternates between the missed item and other items [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Use purposeful example selection.** The choice of problems is critical and should include a wide range of examples to help students generalize a strategy [Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: To teach reading decimals, formats should use "minimally different sets" of problems (e.g., .07, .70, .7) to "focus student attention on the number of digits following the decimal" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5].
    *   Example: When teaching reducing fractions, about a third of the examples should already be in simplest terms so students learn that not all fractions can be reduced [Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 20].

The language used in a format should be carefully selected to be "clear and unambiguous" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. The general rule is to introduce concepts with "student-friendly math vocabulary" before introducing more precise, mathematically correct definitions that contain difficult vocabulary [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9; Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
*   Example: To reduce confusion, a concept can be taught first with simpler terms like "top numeral" and "bottom numeral" for fractions before the more precise terminology ("numerator" and "denominator") is attached later [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].
*   Example: To reduce cognitive demand when introducing addition, the term "plus" is used as a verb before the formal term "addition" is introduced [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4].
*   Example: A problem like `5)20` is read as "5 goes into 20 how many times?" to facilitate the use of multiplication facts [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3, 19].

### Rule Checklists

#### Good Sequence must...

*   **Teach prerequisite skills first.** A new skill should not be introduced until students have mastered the necessary component skills [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
    *   Example: Rote counting is a prerequisite for and is taught before rational counting [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Progress from easy to difficult.** Instruction should begin with simpler concepts and gradually move to more complex ones [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: In subtraction, problems with no renaming are taught before problems that require renaming [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 1, 3].
*   **Separate skills that are likely to be confused.** The introduction of similar-looking or similar-sounding concepts should be separated by several lessons or more [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
    *   Example: Avoid consecutively introducing the skip-counting series for 6s and 4s, as they share several numbers (12, 24, 36) [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Be cumulative.** New skills are not presented until students have mastered previously introduced ones [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8].
    *   Example: When teaching coins, the penny and nickel are introduced first, and only after students can discriminate between them are dimes and then quarters introduced [Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 20].
*   **Include cumulative review.** Worksheets and problem sets should incorporate review of previously taught concepts to ensure retention and discrimination [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11].
    *   Example (not in book): After teaching division, a worksheet should include a mix of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems.
*   **Mix problem types to teach discrimination.** Worksheets should include an unpredictable mix of problem types so students learn to attend to signs and select the correct strategy [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7; Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].
    *   Example: After teaching subtraction with renaming from the hundreds, a worksheet should include problems that require renaming from hundreds, renaming from tens, no renaming, and addition [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 8].

#### Good Format must...

*   **Provide explicit, scripted wording for the teacher.** Formats should articulate instruction in a step-by-step fashion, often in a two-column script [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
    *   Example: Format 7.2 specifies that the teacher should say, "Listen to the equal rule: We must end with the same number on this side... and on the other side... of the equal sign" [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 18].
*   **Follow a gradual release of responsibility.** Instruction should move from teacher-led modeling to guided practice and then to independent student work [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
    *   Example: A format is often composed of a "Structured Board Presentation," a "Structured Worksheet Presentation," and a "Less Structured Worksheet" [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Include explicit teacher modeling.** The teacher must provide clear and detailed demonstrations, which can include the "verbalization of thought processes" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4, 7].
    *   Example (not in book): When solving a multi-step word problem, the teacher says aloud, "First, I need to find the total cost of the apples. I see they are $2 per pound and I need 3 pounds, so I will multiply 2 times 3 to get 6."
*   **Incorporate frequent questioning and monitoring.** Formats should use a high number of questions to check for understanding and keep students engaged [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
    *   Example (not in book): While modeling column addition, a teacher constantly asks, "What do I do first? Which column do I start in? What is 5 plus 8? Do I need to rename?"
*   **Contain specific error-correction procedures.** The format should detail how to respond to common student errors [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 7; Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 6].
    *   Example: If a student makes a coordination error in rational counting, the teacher repeats the task after telling the student to "count only when touching an object" [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Use carefully selected examples.** Examples should be chosen to help students generalize a strategy and practice discrimination, including minimally different pairs and non-examples [Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 20; Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5].
    *   Example: "Format 8.3: Subtraction with Renaming" is cited as an "example of appropriate example selection" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Use clear, student-friendly language initially.** Concepts should be introduced with simple, accessible vocabulary before more formal mathematical terms are taught [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].
    *   Example: When teaching area, a teacher might first define it as "the number of squares it takes to cover the rectangle" before introducing more precise definitions [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].
