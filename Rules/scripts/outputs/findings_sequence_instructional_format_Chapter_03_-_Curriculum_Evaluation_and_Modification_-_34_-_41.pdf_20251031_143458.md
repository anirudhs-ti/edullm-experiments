### Sequence

The concept of 'sequence' in an instructional program refers to the logical order in which skills and concepts are presented [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3, 4]. It is a critical component of a program's "General Program Design" and should be evaluated by examining the "scope and sequence" of each program level [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3]. The text identifies two primary organizational designs related to sequence:

*   **Spiral Design**: In programs with a spiral design, "many topics are introduced at each level and repeated across many levels" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3-4]. These programs are often characterized as being "'a mile wide and inch deep'" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4]. A typical feature is that lessons cover a different topic each day, and the design may lack the "adequate initial instruction and review to promote student mastery" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Strand Design**: In contrast, programs organized with a strand design "present fewer topics over a longer period of time and have a pronounced focus on student mastery" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4]. A unique characteristic of the strand design is that individual lessons are organized around multiple topics [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4]. For instance, a single fourth-grade lesson might cover "multiplication facts, subtraction with regrouping, fraction analysis, and measurement" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4].

Sequence is also related to the concept of "coherence," which is the extent to which program content is integrated "within and across grade levels" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5]. An example of a "coherent sequence" is how fraction topics are "interwoven" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5]. If a program's skills are found to be "not presented in a logical sequence," this is a "potential problem" that requires modification, such as reordering the instruction [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 7].

### Instructional Format

The text describes "instructional formats," also referred to as "teaching formats," as resources that provide "explicit strategies accompanied by specific teaching procedures" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 8]. These formats are presented as key tools for both understanding and modifying curriculum [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5, 7].

Key characteristics and purposes of instructional formats include:

*   **Providing Explicit Strategy Instruction**: Formats are cited as examples of "explicit strategy instruction" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5]. For instance, "Format 10.8: Correct Estimated Quotients with Two-Digit Divisors" is highlighted because it "clearly... illustrates the level of explicitness typical of Direct Instruction" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Delivering Generalizable Strategies**: A well-designed format presents a strategy that is of "intermediate generalizabilityâ€”not too narrow or too broad" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4]. "Format 13.3: Writing Numerical Fractions" is offered as an example of a format that provides a "generalizable strategy that promotes conceptual understanding of both proper and improper fractions" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Teaching Preskills**: Instructional formats can be used to present the component skills, or "preskills," required for a larger strategy [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6]. The text notes that a format may be a "unique teaching format" dedicated to presenting preskills [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Modeling Example Selection**: Formats serve as a guide for selecting appropriate examples for instruction [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6]. "Format 8.3: Subtraction with Renaming" is cited as an "example of appropriate example selection" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Aiding Curriculum Modification**: When a commercial program's instructional strategies are not clearly outlined, a recommended modification is to "Choose explicit instructional strategies from the teaching formats available in the related chapter" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 7].
