### Sequence

The provided text outlines a recommended sequence for introducing topics in data analysis, emphasizing a structured progression from simpler, visual concepts to more complex, numerical ones [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 1, 3]. The "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" lists specific topics in their recommended order of introduction by grade level [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 1, 2].

**General Sequence: From Concrete/Visual to Abstract/Numerical**
*   Graphs are taught before statistics because they are "visual representations of data" and are considered "easier to understand" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 3].
*   The introduction of various graph types must be "carefully coordinated with numeral reading and fraction skills" to ensure students have mastered all component skills beforehand [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 4].

**Sequence for Teaching Tables and Graphs**
1.  **Classifying and Sorting:** In kindergarten, students are first taught to gather and classify data, such as sorting objects into categories [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 2, 6].
2.  **Tables:** After students can accurately classify items, they are taught to record the data in a table [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6]. Tables are introduced in kindergarten [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
3.  **Picture Graphs:** Picture graphs are recommended for introduction in first grade, following instruction in reading and creating tables [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6-7]. This illustrates the "conceptual relationship between tables and graphs" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7].
4.  **Bar Graphs:** Bar graphs are also typically introduced during first grade [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 4].
5.  **Line Plots:** Line plots can be introduced in the early elementary grades [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7].

**Sequence for Question Difficulty**
When teaching students to interpret graphs, a specific sequence of question types is recommended, progressing from simple to complex:
1.  **Literal Questions:** These are introduced first and ask for specific information found directly on the graph, such as "How many points did Sarah score in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. Initial questions about tables should also be literal [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6].
2.  **Comparison Questions:** These questions are "introduced gradually" after students have mastered literal questions [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. They require students to compare two pieces of information, such as "How many more points did Sarah score in January than in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
3.  **Inference Questions:** As the "most difficult type of question," these should be included only after students have mastered the previous two types [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]. An example is, "Why do you think Sarah scored more points in May than in September?" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].

**Sequence for Descriptive Statistics**
*   Descriptive statistics are typically not introduced until middle school [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 8].
*   Statistical concepts should be introduced "cumulatively" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9].
*   The mean is introduced first [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9].
*   The median is introduced after students have "mastered computing the mean" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9].
*   After a new concept is taught, problem sets should incorporate "cumulative review," requiring students to apply all previously learned concepts [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9]. For example, after the mode is introduced, an exercise should require students to compute the mean, median, and mode [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9].

### Instructional Format

An 'instructional format' in the provided text refers to a detailed, scripted teaching procedure designed to introduce a specific skill or concept [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7, 9]. These formats often follow a structured progression that moves from teacher demonstration to guided student practice and finally to independent work.

**Core Structure and Methodology**
*   **Model-Lead-Test/Model-Test:** Many formats follow a "model-lead-test procedure" or a "model-test sequence" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7].
    *   **Model:** The teacher first models the skill. For example, Format 16.4 begins with the teacher modeling how to use data from a table to create a bar graph [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7]. In Format 16.3, the teacher "explains the features of a bar graph and models reading the graph" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7].
    *   **Lead:** The teacher then leads students through the steps. In Format 16.4, the teacher "leads students through the steps of constructing their own bar graphs" on a structured worksheet [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7, 22]. Similarly, in Format 16.1, the teacher "leads the students in determining how many of each shape there are and completing the equations" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6].
    *   **Test:** Finally, students work independently. Format 16.1 includes a "less structured worksheet in which the students independently count different shapes" [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6].

**Components of a Format**
The formats are typically broken down into distinct parts that facilitate this gradual release of responsibility:
*   **Part A: Structured Board Presentation:** This is where the teacher introduces the concept and models the procedure for the students [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7, 9]. For instance, Part A of Format 16.5 is a structured board presentation where the teacher presents the two steps for calculating a mean [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9, 24].
*   **Part B: Structured Worksheet:** This part involves guided practice where the teacher leads students through problems on a worksheet [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6, 7, 9]. In Part B of Format 16.5, the teacher asks students to identify the steps and complete the calculation for real-world problems [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 9, 25].
*   **Part C: Less Structured Worksheet:** This section provides an opportunity for independent practice [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 6]. In Part C of Format 16.1, students are given a worksheet and instructed to "complete the equations that show the total for each shape" on their own [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 14].

**Adaptability**
The procedures outlined in these formats can be adapted for different purposes. For example, the procedures in Format 16.4: Creating Bar Graphs can be adapted for use with students in upper grades to address more complex data or for teaching how to create line plots and stem and leaf plots [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 7, 8].
