# Sequence

The concept of 'sequence' in decimal instruction refers to the specific, hierarchical order in which skills are taught [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1]. This sequence is built upon the principle that some skills are prerequisites for others, and instruction should move from simpler to more complex concepts [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1, 10].

### General Instructional Sequence

The text outlines a main instructional sequence for decimals covering seven areas, which are introduced in a specific order [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1]:
1.  Reading and writing decimals and mixed decimal numerals
2.  Converting decimals to equivalent decimals
3.  Adding and subtracting decimals
4.  Rounding off decimals
5.  Multiplying decimals
6.  Dividing decimals
7.  Converting values between the decimal and fraction notation systems

This overall sequence begins with foundational skills like reading and writing, which must be mastered before moving on to operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1, 4]. The "Instructional Sequence and Assessment Chart" provides a concrete example of this, organizing problem types by grade level to show progression [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 2-4].

### Preskills and Skill Hierarchy

The sequence is based on a "SKILL HIERARCHY" where students must have a strong background in certain "preskills" before beginning decimal instruction [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1, 4].
*   **Prerequisites for all decimals:** A strong understanding of place value with whole numbers, rounding skills, and fraction analysis are necessary before starting decimal instruction [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Prerequisites for specific operations:** Certain decimal skills act as preskills for more advanced ones. For example, converting a decimal to an equivalent decimal is an "important preskill for addition, subtraction, and division" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 7]. Similarly, rounding off decimals is a "necessary component skill for decimal division and percent" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 8].

### Sequencing Within Topics

The concept of sequence also applies within each of the seven main instructional areas, where simpler problem types are introduced before more difficult ones.
*   **Reading and Writing Decimals:** The sequence for introducing reading and writing skills is explicitly listed as follows [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5]:
    1.  Reading tenths or hundredths
    2.  Writing tenths or hundredths
    3.  Reading and writing mixed decimals (tenths or hundredths)
    4.  Reading thousandths
    5.  Writing thousandths
    6.  Reading and writing mixed decimals (thousandths)
    7.  Writing equivalent decimals
    Within this, writing a decimal is taught "immediately after" students can read it [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5]. Thousandths are introduced only "after students have mastered reading and writing decimals and mixed decimals representing tenths and hundredths" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 6].
*   **Addition and Subtraction:** Problems where all numerals have the same number of decimal places are introduced first [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 7]. Problems with different numbers of decimal places are introduced about two weeks later, after students have learned to create equivalent decimals [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 8].
*   **Multiplication:** More confusing problem types, such as those requiring students to place a zero in the answer (e.g., .4 x .2 = .08), are "introduced after the easier types of problems have been mastered" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 10].
*   **Division:** Division problems are categorized into four types of increasing difficulty, starting with whole number divisors and progressing to decimal divisors [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 11]. Problems with decimal divisors are introduced only after students have mastered division with whole number divisors and the preskill of multiplying decimals by multiples of 10 [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 14].

# Instructional Format

An 'instructional format' is a detailed, structured procedure for teaching a specific decimal skill [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5, 6, 9]. These formats provide teachers with explicit steps, wording, and materials for instruction. The text includes numerous examples, such as "Format 14.1: Reading Decimals" and "Format 14.6: Rounding Off Decimals" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5, 9].

### Components of a Format

Instructional formats typically consist of several parts that guide the teacher from initial instruction to student practice.
*   **Demonstration / Structured Board Presentation:** Most formats begin with the teacher introducing a concept, rule, or strategy at the board [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 6, 9, 18]. This part involves the teacher modeling how to solve a problem and testing students with questions [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 6]. Some formats include a "Demonstration" section specifically to illustrate the rationale behind a procedure, such as using equivalent fractions to explain why adding a zero to a decimal does not change its value [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 7, 22].
*   **Worksheet Exercises:** Following the board presentation, students are given worksheets for practice [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5, 6]. These exercises often progress from "structured," where the teacher leads students through the initial problems, to "less structured," where students work more independently [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 10, 20, 23, 25]. The formats themselves are presented as two-column scripts detailing the dialogue for the "TEACHER" and expected "STUDENTS" responses [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 18-32].

### Key Elements of Instructional Formats

The formats described in the text share several key pedagogical elements:
*   **Explicit Strategies:** Formats teach students specific, step-by-step strategies for solving problems. For example, the rounding-off strategy consists of three steps: determining the number of digits, drawing a line, and then checking the numeral after the line to decide whether to add a unit [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 9].
*   **Example Selection:** The formats provide guidelines for selecting examples. A critical guideline is the use of "minimally different sets" of problems (e.g., .07, .70, .7) to "focus student attention on the number of digits following the decimal" [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5].
*   **Teacher Behaviors and Error Correction:** The formats emphasize "critical teacher behavior," such as monitoring student responses to ensure they are adding the "-ths" ending when reading decimals [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5]. They also include specific procedures for correcting errors. For instance, if a student misreads .04, the teacher is instructed to have the student first identify the number of digits after the decimal, then the place value, and then reread the numeral [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5].
