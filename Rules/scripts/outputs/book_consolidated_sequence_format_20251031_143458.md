### What is a 'good' sequence? How to check it? What rules must be followed while creating a sequence? Are there specifics on what types of questions must be there?

A sequence is an instructional design feature that establishes the best possible order for introducing new information, skills, and strategies [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2]. It is a logical and deliberately planned order for presenting skills and concepts to avoid confusion and increase efficiency [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3, 4; Chapter 06 - Basic Facts - 85 - 104.pdf, p. 2; Chapter 15 - Percent Ratio and Probability - 408 - 434.pdf, p. 1]. The order of presentation directly impacts how difficult information is for students to learn [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2]. A sequence can refer to an ordered series of numbers, such as in rote counting, or the recommended order for teaching skills [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 1; Chapter 21 - Glossary - 549 - 550.pdf, p. 2].

**Rules for Creating a Good Sequence**

A good instructional sequence is coherent, consistent, and follows several key rules [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5]:

*   **Teach Preskills First**: Instruction must be sequenced so that necessary component skills, or preskills, are taught before the complete strategy is introduced [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3, 4]. For example, students should master skip-counting before learning multiplication [Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 1], and they must master rounding before learning to solve division problems with two-digit divisors [Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 13].
*   **Progress from Easy to Difficult**: Instruction should progress from simpler to more complex tasks [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. For instance, students should learn to add fractions with like denominators before tackling the more difficult skill of adding fractions with unlike denominators [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. Similarly, multi-digit problems without renaming are taught before problems that require renaming [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 2, 8].
*   **Separate Confusable Skills**: Information or strategies that students are likely to confuse should be separated in the instructional sequence [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. The more similar two skills are, the higher the likelihood of confusion [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. For example, the introduction of the numerals 6 and 9 should not be consecutive [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. Likewise, converting mixed numerals to improper fractions should not be introduced until several months after students learn the reverse skill [Chapter 13 - Fractions - 301 - 375.pdf, p. 22].
*   **Present in Small Steps**: New material should be presented in small, manageable steps, with student practice after each step to ensure progress is made with "relative ease" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3, 4].
*   **Ensure Mastery and Cumulative Review**: New skills should not be introduced until students have demonstrated mastery of previously introduced ones [Chapter 05 - Symbol Identification and Place Value - 56 - 84.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 12 - Measurement Time and Money - 262 - 300.pdf, p. 8]. Skills should be mastered to "overlearning" and supported by "frequent cumulative review" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4, 7].
*   **Mix Problem Types for Discrimination**: Once multiple strategies have been taught, worksheets should include a mix of different problem types to ensure students learn to discriminate which strategy to use [Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7, 8]. For example, addition and subtraction word problems are taught together to provide this discrimination practice [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].

**How to Check a Sequence**

To check if a sequence is good, one should evaluate its overall design and logical flow [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 7].
*   Examine the program's "scope and sequence" to see the order in which skills and concepts are presented [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3].
*   Verify that the sequence is logical and coherent, with content integrated "within and across grade levels" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5]. A "potential problem" exists if skills are "not presented in a logical sequence" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 7].
*   Assess the organizational design. A "strand design," which presents fewer topics over a longer time with a focus on student mastery, is contrasted with a "spiral design," which introduces many topics that are repeated across levels and may lack the instruction and review needed for mastery [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 3-4].

**Specifics on Question Types**

The sequence of instruction can also apply to the types of questions asked. When teaching students to interpret graphs, a specific sequence of question types is recommended, progressing from simple to complex [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5]:
1.  **Literal Questions**: These are introduced first and ask for information found directly on the graph [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
2.  **Comparison Questions**: Introduced after literal questions are mastered, these require students to compare two pieces of information from the graph [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].
3.  **Inference Questions**: As the most difficult type, these are included only after students have mastered the other two types [Chapter 16 - Data Analysis - 435 - 459.pdf, p. 5].

### What is a 'good' format? How to check it? What rules must be followed while creating a format? What language should be used?

An instructional format is a "teaching format or script" that translates explicit instructional strategies into specific, step-by-step teaching procedures [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1]. Formats are designed to ensure teacher explanations are "clear and unambiguous" and consistent [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. They provide "specific teacher wording, examples, and often error-correction procedures" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. These formats are often directly connected to specific educational standards [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1].

**Rules and Components of a Good Format**

A good instructional format is highly structured and contains several key components designed to promote student learning and mastery.

*   **Gradual Release of Responsibility**: Formats follow a "carefully designed instructional sequence" that reflects a "gradual release of responsibility from teacher to student" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. This typically involves a multi-part structure:
    1.  **Structured Board Presentation**: The teacher models the skill, provides demonstrations, and introduces rules [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 10 - Division - 181 - 217.pdf, p. 3; Chapter 17 - Geometry - 460 - 494.pdf, p. 11]. This is often based on a "model-lead-test" procedure [Chapter 04 - Counting - 42 - 55.pdf, p. 4, 9].
    2.  **Structured Worksheet Presentation**: The teacher leads students through a worksheet, providing prompts and guidance for each step [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4, 7, 9].
    3.  **Less Structured Worksheet Presentation**: Students work more independently on problems with fewer teacher prompts [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 09 - Multiplication - 154 - 180.pdf, p. 5].
    4.  **Supervised Practice**: Students work on their own while the teacher monitors performance [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Explicit Modeling and Explanation**: The format must include "Explicit teacher modeling or explanation" with "clear and detailed instructions" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3, 4]. This can include the teacher's "verbalization of thought processes" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 7].
*   **Frequent Questioning and Engagement**: A key characteristic is the "use of frequent questioning" to monitor student understanding and increase engagement [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. The format should prompt the teacher to ask many questions and obtain responses from all students [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 4].
*   **Systematic Feedback and Correction**: Formats must include procedures for providing "systematic" feedback and "explicit corrections of errors" [Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3, 4]. Specific wording for correcting common errors is often embedded within the format [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 7; Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 19, 21, 23].
*   **Generalizable Strategies**: A well-designed format presents a strategy that is of "intermediate generalizabilityâ€”not too narrow or too broad" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 4]. The goal is to deliver strategies that "promote conceptual understanding and develop reasoning skills" [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Careful Example Selection**: Formats should guide the selection of appropriate examples [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6]. This includes using "minimally different sets" of problems to focus student attention and an "unpredictable mix of problems" to provide discrimination practice [Chapter 14 - Decimals - 376 - 407.pdf, p. 5; Chapter 08 - Subtraction - 132 - 153.pdf, p. 7].

**How to Check a Format**

To check if a format is good, one should look beyond its scripted appearance and evaluate the quality of the instructional strategy it delivers [Chapter 20 - Appendix B Frequently Asked Questions About Direct Instruction Mathematics - 546 - 548.pdf, p. 1].
*   Verify that teacher explanations are "clear and unambiguous" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
*   Check that the format provides a "generalizable strategy that promotes conceptual understanding" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 5].
*   Ensure the format includes "appropriate example selection" [Chapter 03 - Curriculum Evaluation and Modification - 34 - 41.pdf, p. 6] and explicit error-correction procedures [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 7].
*   Confirm that the format includes the key components of explicit modeling, guided practice, independent practice, and frequent questioning [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 02 - Research Support for Direct Instruction Mathematics - 27 - 33.pdf, p. 3].

**Language to be Used**

The language within an instructional format should be intentional, clear, and supportive of student learning.
*   Formats provide "specific teacher wording" and are often scripted, sometimes in a two-column layout detailing teacher dialogue and expected student responses [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4; Chapter 18 - Pre-algebra - 495 - 529.pdf, p. 20-35].
*   Use "student-friendly math vocabulary" when first introducing a concept before moving to more precise, mathematically correct definitions [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9]. For example, "top numeral" and "bottom numeral" can be used before "numerator" and "denominator" to reduce confusion [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9]. Similarly, "plus" can be used as a verb before the formal term "addition" is introduced [Chapter 07 - Addition - 105 - 131.pdf, p. 4].
