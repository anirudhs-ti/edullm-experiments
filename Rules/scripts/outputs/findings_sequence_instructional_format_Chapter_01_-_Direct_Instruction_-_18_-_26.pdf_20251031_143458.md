### Sequence

Sequence, or sequencing, is an instructional design feature that involves establishing the best possible order for introducing new information, skills, and strategies to students [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2]. The order in which skills and information are presented has a direct impact on how difficult they are for students to learn [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 2]. The text outlines three general guidelines for sequencing instruction [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3].

1.  **Teach preskills for a strategy before teaching the strategy** [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. Instruction should be sequenced so that the necessary component skills, or preskills, are taught before the complete strategy is introduced [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]. For example, before teaching students to solve subtraction problems with zeros that require regrouping (e.g., 3,002 – 89), a recommended preskill to teach is "hundreds-minus-one problems (300 – 1 = 299)" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. This is because the larger problem requires renaming 300 tens as 299 tens [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. Similarly, when teaching language, vocabulary terms that are necessary for a concept (e.g., "side," "equal," "same") should be taught before the concept itself (e.g., the equality rule) is introduced [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].

2.  **Teach easy skills before more difficult ones** [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. This guideline suggests that instruction should progress from simpler to more complex tasks [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. An example provided is teaching students to add fractions with like denominators before teaching the more difficult skill of adding fractions with unlike denominators [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. In language instruction, this means introducing concepts with "student-friendly math vocabulary" (e.g., defining area as "the number of squares it takes to cover the rectangle") before introducing more precise, mathematically correct definitions that contain difficult vocabulary [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].

3.  **Separate the introduction of information or strategies that students are likely to confuse** [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. The text notes that the more similar two skills are, the higher the likelihood that students will confuse them [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. For instance, because young students often confuse the numerals 6 and 9, their introduction should not be consecutive [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. Another example is to avoid consecutively introducing the skip-counting series for 6s and 4s, as they share several numbers (12, 24, 36), which is likely to cause confusion [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. This guideline also applies to language; to reduce confusion, a concept can be taught first with simpler terms (e.g., "top numeral" and "bottom numeral" for fractions) before the more precise terminology ("numerator" and "denominator") is attached later [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 9].

### Instructional Format

Instructional formats are defined as "teaching formats or scripts" that translate explicit instructional strategies into specific teaching procedures [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 3]. They are designed to ensure that teacher explanations are "clear and unambiguous" and consistent from one day to the next [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].

**Components and Purpose:**
*   Formats provide "specific teacher wording, examples, and often error-correction procedures" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
*   Specific wording for correcting common student errors can often be found within the teaching formats [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 7].
*   A key characteristic of formats is the "use of frequent questioning," which allows teachers to continuously monitor student understanding and also increases student engagement [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].

**Structure:**
*   The teaching formats follow a "carefully designed instructional sequence" that reflects a "gradual release of responsibility from teacher to student" [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
*   Most formats are composed of four distinct parts [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4]:
    1.  A structured board presentation
    2.  A structured worksheet presentation
    3.  A less structured worksheet presentation
    4.  Supervised practice
*   The text notes that it provides links to teaching formats for the strategies discussed in each chapter, and some are accompanied by video demonstrations [Chapter 01 - Direct Instruction - 18 - 26.pdf, p. 4].
