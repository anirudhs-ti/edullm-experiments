### Sequence

A 'sequence' is described in the provided text in several contexts, primarily related to numbers and operations.

*   **Counting Sequence:** The text refers to the "count sequence" in the context of knowing number names and the order in which they are said [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. Students are expected to be able to count forward from any number within a known sequence, rather than always having to start at 1 [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. This counting sequence can be extended, for instance, to 120 [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Pattern Generation:** A sequence can be a pattern of numbers generated by following a specific rule [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 10]. For example, given the rule "Add 3" and a starting number of 1, a student would generate terms in the resulting sequence [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 10]. The text also describes generating two numerical patterns from two given rules and observing the relationships between the "resulting sequences" [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 13].
*   **Sequence of Operations:** The term is also used to describe a series of mathematical operations. For example, interpreting the product `(a/b) × q` can be seen as "the result of a sequence of operations a × q ÷ b" [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 14].

### Instructional Format

An 'instructional format' is a specific teaching procedure designed to address particular educational standards presented in the text [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1].

*   **Definition and Purpose:** The document explicitly states that the table it contains presents the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) alongside "related formats and/or teaching procedures that can be found in this text" [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. Formats are listed for individual standards within larger groups called "clusters" and "domains" [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Connection to Standards:** Many formats are directly connected to an individual standard [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. The text provides a table with a "Format" column that lists specific formats, identified by numbers like 4.1, 4.4, 5.1, etc., that meet each standard [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. For example, to meet the standard "Count to 100 by ones and by tens," formats 4.1, 4.4, and 4.5 are listed [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Application and Flexibility:** Formats assigned to individual standards also apply to the broader "cluster" and "domain" headings they fall under [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. However, not all standards have a specific format listed; in these cases, the chapter(s) that address the standard are included instead [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1]. Furthermore, some standards require "blending content and teaching procedures from multiple formats and chapters" [Chapter 19 - Appendix A Direct Instruction Mathematics and Common Core State Standards - 530 - 545.pdf, p. 1].
