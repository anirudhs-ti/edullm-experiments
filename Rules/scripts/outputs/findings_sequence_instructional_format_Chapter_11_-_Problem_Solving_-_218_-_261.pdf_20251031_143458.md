### Sequence

The instructional sequence for teaching word problems is a structured progression designed to build skills systematically [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1]. The text recommends a specific order for introducing different types of word problems, with a clear rationale for the sequence [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].

**General Progression:**
*   **Addition and Subtraction First:** Addition and subtraction word problems are introduced together, typically in late first grade [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1]. Teaching them together is done to "provide discrimination practice" [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Multiplication and Division Later:** Multiplication and division word problems are introduced later, usually during third grade [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 2]. These are introduced only after students have mastered addition and subtraction word problems and have learned to solve multiplication and division computation problems [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1, 17]. Like addition and subtraction, they are taught together to provide practice in choosing the correct operation [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].
*   **Mixing Operations:** Once multiplication and division problems are introduced, it is important for students to work on mixed sets of problems that involve all four operations to continue practicing the selection of the correct operation [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 1].

**Detailed Grade-Level Sequence:**
The "INSTRUCTIONAL SEQUENCE AND ASSESSMENT CHART" outlines a recommended sequence for introducing specific problem types by grade level:
*   **Grades 1-2:** The sequence begins with "Addition/subtraction simple action problems with key words" [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 2].
*   **Grade 2:** The sequence progresses to more complex addition and subtraction problems, including "temporal sequence problems," "comparison problems," and "classification problems." Simple "Multi-step problems" involving the addition of three numerals are also introduced [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 2].
*   **Grade 3:** Multiplication and division problems are introduced, starting with those that contain signal words like "each" or "every," and later those with "per" or a phrase using "a" [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 2]. Problems with larger numerals for all four operations and addition/subtraction problems with "distractors" are also introduced at this level [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Grade 4:** The sequence continues with more complex problems, including division and multiplication with larger numerals (e.g., two-digit divisors) and various types of multi-step problems that combine operations [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 3].
*   **Grade 5:** The complexity increases further with multi-step problems involving four or five numerals and multiple operations [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 3].

**Preskill Sequencing:**
The sequence also includes the teaching of specific preskills before introducing a new concept.
*   About three weeks before word problems are formally introduced, a preskill format teaches students to translate key phrases like "get more" and "get rid of" into mathematical symbols [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5].
*   An essential preskill for the number-family strategy, which involves finding the missing number in a fact family, should be taught "approximately 2 or 3 weeks before temporal sequence problems are first introduced" [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 7].

### Instructional Format

An instructional format, as presented in the text, is a detailed, structured procedure for teaching a specific type of word problem [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18]. These formats are designed to be systematic and often include scripted teacher dialogue and expected student responses [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 20-44].

**Common Structure and Components:**
Instructional formats typically follow a multi-part structure that progresses from foundational skills to independent application.
*   **Part A: Preskills:** Many formats begin with a preskill section designed to teach prerequisite knowledge [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 9, 11, 12, 18]. For example, Format 11.1 starts by demonstrating how a word problem can be represented with pictures and translated into an equation [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 20]. Format 11.5 begins with a language preskill on identifying class names (e.g., "animals" is the biggest class for "cats" and "dogs") before teaching classification problems [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 12, 34].
*   **Part B: Structured Presentation/Worksheet:** This part usually involves a "Structured Board Presentation" or a "Structured Worksheet" where the teacher explicitly demonstrates the problem-solving strategy and guides students through the steps [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 9, 11, 12]. For instance, in Format 11.3, the teacher leads students through analyzing temporal sequence problems by first determining if a person "starts or ends with more" and then figuring out if the total is given [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 9-10].
*   **Part C & D: Less Structured Practice:** As students gain proficiency, the formats move to "Less Structured Worksheet" exercises [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 10, 11, 13]. In these parts, the teacher provides less guidance, asking students to apply the strategy more independently. For example, in Part D of Format 11.3, the teacher asks students to identify if the person starts or ends with more and then has them complete the number-family diagram and find the answer on their own [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 10, 31].

**Core Strategies within Formats:**
*   The formats consistently use a "number-family" strategy to analyze and solve various problem types, including temporal sequence, comparison, classification, and multi-step problems [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 9, 10, 15, 17]. This strategy involves identifying the "total" or "big number" in a problem to determine whether to add or subtract (or multiply or divide) [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 6, 7].
*   "Example selection" is noted as being very important for the formats; problems should initially be short with common verbs and decodable words, and a random mix of problem types should be used to ensure students learn to discriminate between them [Chapter 11 - Problem Solving - 218 - 261.pdf, p. 5, 10].
