If there are 8 things in the can and 3 of them are triangles, you can expect that if a person took 8 trials they would probably pull a triangle from the can 3 times. If the probability fraction 3/8 is the fraction for 8 trials, then any fraction that is equivalent to 3/8 will tell about a different number of trials.

First, you need to know that everything to the left of the equal sign is called the 'left side.' Highlight the left side of the equation. What is everything to the left of the equal sign called? Everything to the right of the equal sign is called the 'right side.' Highlight the right side of the equation. What is everything to the right of the equal sign called? | Student: The left side
The right side || Step 3 | Teacher: We want to find the value for the letter p in this equation. To do that, we need to get p all by itself on one side of the equation. We're going to get p all by itself by adding the inverse of negative 4. What is the inverse of negative 4? Negative 4 plus 4 equals 0, leaving p all by itself. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: p - 4 = 6 + 4 | Student: 4 || Step 4 | Teacher: Here's an important rule about changing an equation: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other. Present the rule. We added 4 to the left side of the equation. That means we also must add 4 to the right side of the equation. What do we need to do to the right side of the equation? | Student: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other.
Add 4 || Step 5 | Teacher: Yes, we added 4 to the left side of the equation, so we also need to add 4 to the right side of the equation.

We want to find the value for r. To do that, you need to get r by itself by adding the inverse. What do you need to do to get r by itself? What's the inverse of 2? Do that. Add - 2 to the side of the equation with r. | Student: r + 2 = 18
Add the inverse
-2 || Step 3 | Teacher: Now that you have added -2 to the left side of the equation, what must you do to the right side of the equation? Yes, whatever you do to one side of an equation you must do to another. Add -2 to the right side of the equation. | Student: Add -2 || Step 4 | Teacher: Now you can finish working the equation to find the value of r. Do that now. || Step 5 | Teacher: What does r equal? | Student: r equals 16 || Step 6 | Teacher: You can check your work by rewriting the equation with 16 in the place of r. Do that now. You put 16 in the place of r. Read the new equation. Does that make sense? | Student: 16 + 2 = 18

One || Part: Part B | Description: Structured Board Presentation | Steps: Step 1 | Teacher: Display the following equation: 5e = 15 || Step 2 | Teacher: We want to find the value for the variable e in this equation. To do that, we need to get e all by itself on one side of the equation. We're going to get e all by itself by multiplying by the reciprocal of 5, so that we end up with 1e. What is the reciprocal of 5? 5 multiplied by 1/5 equals 1, leaving 1e or e. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (1/5)5e = 15 | Student: 1/5 || Step 3 | Teacher: Remember the rule about changing an equation: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other. Present the rule. We multiplied the left side of the equation by 1/5. That means we must multiply the right side of the equation by 1/5. What do we need to do to the right side of the equation? | Student: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other.
Multiply by 1/5 || Step 4 | Teacher: Yes, we multiplied the left side of the equation by 1/5, so we need to multiply the right side of the equation by 1/5. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (1/5)5e = 15(1/5). Now that we have multiplied both sides of the equation by 1/5, we can work the equation. What is 1/5 multiplied by 5? | Student: 1 || Step 5 | Teacher: Yes, so we can cross out 1/5 and 5 on the left side of the equation. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (1/5)5e = 15(1/5). Now we work the right side of the equation. What is 15 times 1/5? | Student: 3 || Step 6 | Teacher: Right! Now our equation looks like this: Display the following next to the original equation: e = 3. We changed both sides of the equation to find out that e = 3. What does e equal? | Student: 3 || Step 7 | Teacher: We can check our work by rewriting the equation with 3 in the place of e. Display the following: 5(3) = 15. Does 5 × 3 = 15? | Student: Yes || Step 8 | Teacher: Yes, it does. So we know that e = 3 because 5 × 3 = 15. Let's try another one. Display the following equation: b/2 = 9 || Step 9 | Teacher: We want to find the value for the variable b in this equation. To do that, we need to get b all by itself on one side of the equation. You need to know that b/2 is the same as (1/2)b. Erase b/2 and write (1/2)b in its place. We're going to get b all by itself by multiplying by the reciprocal of 1/2, so that we end up with 1b. What is the reciprocal of 1/2? 1/2 multiplied by 2/1 equals 1, leaving 1b or b. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (2/1)(1/2)b = 9 | Student: 2/1 || Step 10 | Teacher: Remember the rule about changing an equation: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other. We multiplied the left side of the equation by 2/1. What must we do to the right side of the equation? | Student: Multiply by 2/1 || Step 11 | Teacher: Yes, we multiplied the left side of the equation by 2/1, so we need to multiply the right side of the equation by 2/1. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (2/1)(1/2)b = 9(2/1). Now that we have multiplied both sides of the equation by 2/1, we can work the equation. What is 2/1 multiplied by 1/2? | Student: 1 || Step 12 | Teacher: Yes, so we can cross out 2/1 and 1/2 on the left side of the equation. Add to the equation so it looks like the following: (2/1)(1/2)b = 9(2/1). Now we work the right side of the equation. What is 9 times 2/1? | Student: 18 || Step 13 | Teacher: Now our equation looks like this: Display the following next to the original equation: b = 18. We changed both sides of the equation to find out that b = 18. What does b equal? | Student: 18 || Step 14 | Teacher: We can check our work by rewriting the equation with 18 in the place of b. Display the following: 18/2 = 9. Does 18 divided by 2 equal 9? | Student: Yes || Step 15 | Teacher: Yes, it does. So we know that b = 18 because 18 divided by 2 equals 9. Repeat with the following examples: 14 = 2s, 5f = 25, 4 = m/6 || Part: Part C | Description: Less Structured Board Presentation | Steps: Step 1 | Teacher: Display problems like the following. a. 5y = 30 b. 18 = 6e c. 21/x = 7 d. 45 = 5n || Step 2 | Teacher: Read problem a. | Student: 5y = 30 || Step 3 | Teacher: We want to find the value for y. What do you need to do to get y by itself? What's the reciprocal of 5? After you multiply the side of the equation with y by 1/5, what will you do? | Student: Multiply by the reciprocal of 5
1/5
Multiply the other side of the equation by 1/5 || Step 4 | Teacher: Yes, whatever you do to one side of an equation you must do to the other. Work the equation now to find the value of y. || Step 5 | Teacher: What does y equal? | Student: y equals 6 || Step 6 | Teacher: You can check your work by rewriting the equation with 6 in the place of y. Do that now. You put 6 in the place of y. Read the new equation. Does that make sense? | Student: 5 times 6 equals 30
Yes || Step 7 | Teacher: Yes, it does. So your answer is correct. Repeat steps 2-6 with the remaining problems. Instruct the students to follow the same steps to find the value of the variable regardless of which side the variable is on. || Part: Part D | Description: Independent Practice | Steps: Step 1 | Teacher: Display problems like the following. a. 2t = 20 b. 100/x = 25 c. 80 = 20f d. 13 = m/2 e. 9k = 9 || Step 2 | Teacher: Find the value of the variable in each of the equations.
