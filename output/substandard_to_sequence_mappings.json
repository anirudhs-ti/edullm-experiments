The divisor and quotient are appropriate for the grade level, and the use of visual aids is supportive. However, the substandard specifically requires the problem to be presented 'in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers'. The examples use long division notation (e.g., '3)15'), which is a procedural format, not an equation like '15 \u00f7 3 = \u25a1'."

              "explanation": "This sequence addresses division with remainders, which is a 3rd-grade topic. However, it fails on two key aspects of the substandard. First, similar to Sequence #1, the problems are presented in long division notation (e.g., '5)38') rather than an equation format as required. Second, the substandard specifies finding 'the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers'. Division with a remainder typically results in two 'unknowns' (quotient and remainder) and can complicate the 'relating three whole numbers' into a simple equation structure without explicitly defining how the remainder fits into that three-number relationship."

              "explanation": "This sequence perfectly matches the curriculum substandard. It requires determining 'the unknown whole number' (represented by \u25a1) 'in a division equation' (using the \u00f7 sign, e.g., '8 \u00f7 2 = \u25a1') 'relating three whole numbers' (the dividend, divisor, and quotient). The examples use single-digit divisors and quotients, and the absence of remainders keeps the focus on a direct three-number relationship, all of which are appropriate and align with 3rd-grade expectations and typical assessment boundaries."
