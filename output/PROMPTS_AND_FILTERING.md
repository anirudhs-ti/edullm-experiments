## Batch Rating Prompt

### Full Prompt Template

```
You are an impartial expert evaluator validating whether Grade {grade} math substandards align with problem sequences. Judge alignment ONLY using the substandard text, its assessment boundary, and the grade. For each sequence, independently assign one of: EXCELLENT, FAIR, POOR, or NON-EXISTENT, and provide structured rationale.

RUBRIC
- EXCELLENT: Direct and complete coverage of the substandard's intent at the given grade; tasks primarily require the target skill; steps/representations/terminology and difficulty match the assessment boundary; minimal extraneous skills.
- FAIR: Meaningful partial coverage; supports a key component but misses some aspects (scope, representation, boundary) or needs minor adaptation.
- POOR: Weak or indirect alignment; touches topic but the main work does not address the substandard as written, or grade/rigor is off; would need substantial changes.
- NON-EXISTENT: No real alignment; different topic or skill.

CLASSIFICATIONS (deterministic)
- boundary_classification: 
  * COMPLIANT - Fully respects all assessment boundary constraints
  * MINOR_VIOLATION - Violates 1 minor constraint or partially violates a key constraint
  * MAJOR_VIOLATION - Violates multiple constraints or severely violates a key constraint
- grade_alignment:
  * ON_GRADE - Appropriate difficulty and complexity for Grade {grade}
  * SLIGHTLY_OFF - Mostly appropriate but slightly too easy/hard
  * OFF_GRADE - Clearly wrong grade level
- extraneous_skill_load:
  * LOW - Minimal skills beyond the substandard required
  * MODERATE - Some additional skills needed but manageable
  * HIGH - Substantial prerequisite or parallel skills required

SCORING
- alignment_score: integer 0–100 reflecting strength of alignment given the substandard, boundary, and grade. Typical bands:
  * EXCELLENT: 85–100
  * FAIR: 60–84
  * POOR: 25–59
  * NON-EXISTENT: 0–24
- Ensure bands and labels are consistent (e.g., do not assign EXCELLENT with alignment_score 70).

RULES
- Rate EACH sequence independently; do not compare sequences to each other.
- Consider skill_name only as optional context; prioritize what the sequence actually demands.
- Cite the assessment boundary when it affects your judgment.
- Be deterministic; no randomness.
- Output MUST strictly follow the JSON schema with no extra fields or text.

SUBSTANDARD (Grade {grade})
{substandard_desc}

ASSESSMENT BOUNDARY
{assessment_boundary}

SEQUENCES TO RATE (evaluate every item exactly once)
{sequences_json}

Return ONLY valid JSON with no prose before or after, in exactly this structure:
{
  "sequence_ratings": [
    {
      "skill_name": "<string from input>",
      "sequence_number": <int>,
      "problem_type": "<string from input>",
      "match_quality": "EXCELLENT|FAIR|POOR|NON-EXISTENT",
      "boundary_classification": "COMPLIANT|MINOR_VIOLATION|MAJOR_VIOLATION",
      "grade_alignment": "ON_GRADE|SLIGHTLY_OFF|OFF_GRADE",
      "extraneous_skill_load": "LOW|MODERATE|HIGH",
      "alignment_score": <int 0-100>,
      "explanation": "<>= 20 words citing concrete elements and boundary considerations>"
    }
  ],
  "excellent_sequences": [<list of sequence_number values rated EXCELLENT>]
}

IMPORTANT:
- sequence_ratings must contain one entry per input sequence
- excellent_sequences must list ONLY the sequence_number values rated EXCELLENT
- Each explanation must be >= 20 words and cite specific elements
- alignment_score must be consistent with match_quality band
```

### Key Prompt Design Choices

1. **Rich classification scheme**: Added 3 dimensions (boundary, grade, skill load) beyond just match quality
2. **Explicit scoring**: 0-100 score with prescribed bands per quality level
3. **Deterministic emphasis**: "No randomness" to ensure reproducibility
4. **Context separation**: "Consider skill_name only as context" to avoid bias from Phase 1

## Filtering Strategy

### Eligibility Filter (Stage 1)

```python
def is_eligible(rating: Dict) -> bool:
    """Check if sequence is eligible for top 5"""
    # Must be EXCELLENT or FAIR
    if rating['match_quality'] not in ['EXCELLENT', 'FAIR']:
        return False
    
    # Exclude MAJOR_VIOLATION
    if rating['boundary_classification'] == 'MAJOR_VIOLATION':
        return False
    
    # Exclude OFF_GRADE
    if rating['grade_alignment'] == 'OFF_GRADE':
        return False
    
    return True
```

**Rationale:**
- POOR/NON-EXISTENT don't provide value
- MAJOR_VIOLATION means unusable without significant modification
- OFF_GRADE means inappropriate for target grade level

### Scoring Formula (Stage 2)

```python
def calculate_final_score(rating: Dict) -> float:
    """Calculate final score with penalties"""
    # Base weight by quality
    base_weight = 1.0 if rating['match_quality'] == 'EXCELLENT' else 0.75
    
    # Calculate penalties
    penalties = 0.0
    
    if rating['boundary_classification'] == 'MINOR_VIOLATION':
        penalties += 0.10
    
    if rating['grade_alignment'] == 'SLIGHTLY_OFF':
        penalties += 0.10
    
    if rating['extraneous_skill_load'] == 'MODERATE':
        penalties += 0.05
    elif rating['extraneous_skill_load'] == 'HIGH':
        penalties += 0.15
    
    # Final score
    final_score = base_weight * (rating['alignment_score'] / 100.0) - penalties
    
    return final_score
```

**Example calculations:**

| Case | Quality | Align Score | Boundary | Grade | Skill Load | Final Score |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Perfect | EXCELLENT | 95 | COMPLIANT | ON_GRADE | LOW | 0.95 |
| Good | EXCELLENT | 90 | MINOR_VIOLATION | ON_GRADE | LOW | 0.80 |
| Decent | FAIR | 75 | COMPLIANT | ON_GRADE | LOW | 0.56 |
| Weak | FAIR | 65 | MINOR_VIOLATION | SLIGHTLY_OFF | MODERATE | 0.24 |

### Ranking with Tie-Breakers (Stage 3)

```python
def sort_key(rating: Dict) -> Tuple:
    """Multi-level sort key for deterministic ranking"""
    return (
        1 if rating['match_quality'] == 'EXCELLENT' else 0,  # EXCELLENT first
        rating['final_score'],  # Higher score better
        0 if rating['boundary_classification'] == 'COMPLIANT' else 1,  # COMPLIANT first
        {'LOW': 0, 'MODERATE': 1, 'HIGH': 2}[rating['extraneous_skill_load']],  # LOW first
        0 if rating['grade_alignment'] == 'ON_GRADE' else 1,  # ON_GRADE first
        rating['sequence_number']  # Deterministic final tie-break
    )

# Sort descending, then take top 5
eligible.sort(key=sort_key, reverse=True)
top_5 = eligible[:5]
```

**Tie-breaking priority:**
1. Quality tier (EXCELLENT beats FAIR always)
2. Calculated score (accounts for penalties)
3. Boundary compliance (clean beats violations)
4. Skill efficiency (low overhead beats high)
5. Grade appropriateness (on-grade beats slightly-off)
6. Sequence number (deterministic)

## Filtering Examples

### Example 1: Clean EXCELLENT Win

```json
{
  "skill_name": "Multiplication",
  "sequence_number": 1,
  "match_quality": "EXCELLENT",
  "boundary_classification": "COMPLIANT",
  "grade_alignment": "ON_GRADE",
  "extraneous_skill_load": "LOW",
  "alignment_score": 100
}
```

- ✅ Eligible: EXCELLENT + no violations + on-grade
- **Final score**: 1.0 × (100/100) - 0 = **1.00**
- **Rank**: #1 (perfect match)

### Example 2: FAIR with Minor Issues

```json
{
  "skill_name": "Problem Solving",
  "sequence_number": 2,
  "match_quality": "FAIR",
  "boundary_classification": "MINOR_VIOLATION",
  "grade_alignment": "ON_GRADE",
  "extraneous_skill_load": "MODERATE",
  "alignment_score": 70
}
```

- ✅ Eligible: FAIR + no major violation + not off-grade
- **Final score**: 0.75 × (70/100) - 0.10 - 0.05 = **0.375**
- **Rank**: Lower (FAIR + penalties)

### Example 3: Rejected - MAJOR_VIOLATION

```json
{
  "skill_name": "Division",
  "sequence_number": 3,
  "match_quality": "FAIR",
  "boundary_classification": "MAJOR_VIOLATION",
  "grade_alignment": "ON_GRADE",
  "extraneous_skill_load": "LOW",
  "alignment_score": 75
}
```

- ❌ Ineligible: MAJOR_VIOLATION → excluded
- Does not appear in top 5

### Example 4: Rejected - OFF_GRADE

```json
{
  "skill_name": "Geometry",
  "sequence_number": 4,
  "match_quality": "FAIR",
  "boundary_classification": "COMPLIANT",
  "grade_alignment": "OFF_GRADE",
  "extraneous_skill_load": "LOW",
  "alignment_score": 65
}
```

- ❌ Ineligible: OFF_GRADE → excluded
- Does not appear in top 5

## Actual Results: Scoring Distribution

### Alignment Score Ranges (79 matches total)

| Range | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| 90-100 | 18 | 22.8% |
| 85-89 | 7 | 8.9% |
| 70-84 | 25 | 31.6% |
| 60-69 | 29 | 36.7% |

### Final Score Distribution (after penalties)

| Range | Count | % | Typical Quality |
|-------|-------|---|-----------------|
| 0.90-1.00 | 12 | 15.2% | EXCELLENT, perfect |
| 0.75-0.89 | 18 | 22.8% | EXCELLENT, minor issues |
| 0.50-0.74 | 28 | 35.4% | FAIR, good alignment |
| 0.30-0.49 | 21 | 26.6% | FAIR, with penalties |

## Validation Against Hand-Checked Examples

### Case: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+4 (Solve real-world multiplication problems)

**Brute-force found:**
- Seq #2 (Problem Solving): FAIR, score=70
- Seq #1 (Problem Solving): FAIR, score=70
- Seq #4 (Measurement): FAIR, score=65

**Validation experiment also found:**
- Same 3 sequences as FAIR

**Verdict**: ✅ Matches validation results

### Case: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.MD.B.4+1 (Generate measurement data with rulers)

**Brute-force found:**
- Seq #3 (Data Analysis): FAIR, score=65

**Validation experiment also found:**
- Same sequence as FAIR

**Verdict**: ✅ Matches validation results

---

## Why This Works Better Than Phase 1

### Phase 1 Failures (Original Approach)

```
Substandard: "Solve real-world multiplication problems"
Phase 1 selects: "Multiplication" only
Misses: Problem Solving skill (contains word problems)
Result: False negative
```

### Brute-Force Success (New Approach)

```
Substandard: "Solve real-world multiplication problems"
Evaluates: ALL 38 sequences across 7 skills
Finds: 
  - Problem Solving #1: FAIR 70
  - Problem Solving #2: FAIR 70
  - Measurement #4: FAIR 65 (has real-world contexts)
Result: Correct matches found
```

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Original (Two-Phase)
- **Time**: ~60s per substandard
- **Cost**: ~$0.10 per substandard
- **Recall**: ~40% (misses cross-skill matches)

### New (Brute-Force)
- **Time**: ~38s per substandard (**37% faster!**)
- **Cost**: ~$0.15 per substandard (+50%)
- **Recall**: ~100% (finds all eligible matches)

**Trade-off**: Pay 50% more, get 100% recall, and it's actually faster.

---

## Filtering Decisions Summary

### What Gets Kept (Top 5)
✅ EXCELLENT with high alignment scores  
✅ FAIR with compliant boundaries  
✅ On-grade sequences with low skill overhead  

### What Gets Filtered Out
❌ POOR and NON-EXISTENT (obvious)  
❌ MAJOR_VIOLATION (unusable without major changes)  
❌ OFF_GRADE (wrong difficulty level)  
❌ Bottom-ranked after penalties (if more than 5 eligible)  

### Edge Cases
- **Exactly 5 eligible**: Keep all
- **Fewer than 5 eligible**: Keep all (e.g., 1-4 matches)
- **More than 5 eligible**: Use scoring + tie-breakers to select top 5

---

## Reproducibility

All scoring is deterministic. To reproduce:

```bash
cd Experiment_Bruteforce_Validation_Oct2025
python generate_new_mappings.py
```

**Seeds**: None needed (deterministic prompt, deterministic scoring)  
**Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (or any model supporting structured output)  
**Expected runtime**: ~40 minutes for 63 substandards  
**Expected cost**: ~$10 USD  

---

## Quality Assurance Performed

✅ **Schema validation**: All 79 matches have consistent 5-field structure  
✅ **Score/quality alignment**: No EXCELLENT below 85, no FAIR outside 60-84  
✅ **Comparison to validation**: Matches validation experiment results  
✅ **No data loss**: All 23 original matches preserved  
✅ **No duplicates**: Each (skill, sequence_number) pair appears once per substandard  

---

## Conclusion

The filtering strategy successfully selected high-quality matches while:
- Maintaining strict boundary compliance
- Ensuring grade appropriateness
- Minimizing extraneous skill requirements
- Providing transparent quality metrics for downstream decisions

The top 5 cap ensures manageable match sets while the scoring system ensures the best 5 are selected deterministically.
