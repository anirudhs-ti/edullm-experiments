# Composition Summary

## File Created
- **File**: `composed_substandards.json`
- **Size**: 2.8 MB
- **Location**: `/workspaces/github-com-anirudhs-ti-edullm-experiments/Question Generation/`
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Composition Results

### Statistics
- **Total Substandards**: 112
- **Path A (sequences.json)**: 59 substandards
- **Path B (mappings.v3.json)**: 53 substandards
- **Total Sequences**: 311
- **Sequences with Formats**: 298 (95.8%)
- **Sequences without Formats**: 13 (4.2%)

### Quality Filter Applied
- **Keep**: EXCELLENT and FAIR quality only
- **Filtered Out**: POOR quality (none found)
- **Result**: 100% of sequences passed filter

## Data Sources

### Path A (New Generated Sequences)
- **sequences.json**: Generated sequences for substandards
- **formats.json**: Corresponding DI lesson formats
- **Coverage**: 59 substandards with 2-5 sequences each
- **Source**: Newly generated content

### Path B (Legacy Mappings)
- **substandard_to_sequence_mappings.v3.json**: Maps to legacy sequences
- **generated_formats_20251030_125804.json**: Formats for legacy sequences
- **Coverage**: 53 substandards with 1-5 matches each
- **Source**: Mapped to existing legacy content

## Output Structure

Each substandard in the output includes:

```json
{
  "substandard_id": "CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.xxx",
  "substandard_description": "...",
  "assessment_boundary": "...",
  "grade": 3.0,
  "sequences": [
    {
      "source": "Path A" or "Path B",
      "sequence_number": 1,
      "problem_type": "...",
      "example_questions": [...],
      "visual_aids": [...],
      "format": {
        "format_number": "...",
        "title": "...",
        "parts": [...],
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Path Selection Logic

1. **If substandard in Path A**: Use Path A sequences (preferred)
   - Keep ALL sequences (they form a progression)
   - Attach formats from formats.json

2. **Else if substandard in Path B**: Use Path B sequences
   - Filter by quality (EXCELLENT + FAIR only)
   - If matches have formats → Keep ALL
   - If matches don't have formats → Keep top 2-3 by alignment_score
   - Attach formats from generated_formats_20251030_125804.json

## Coverage Analysis

### Substandards by Source
- Path A only: 59 substandards (newly generated)
- Path B only: 53 substandards (legacy mappings)
- **Total**: 112 unique substandards
- **Overlap**: 0 (paths are complementary)

### Format Coverage
- 298 out of 311 sequences have formats (95.8%)
- 13 sequences missing formats (4.2%)
- Missing formats are mostly from Path B matches without corresponding generated formats

## Files Created

1. **compose_substandards.py**: Implementation script
2. **composed_substandards.json**: Final composed output
3. **COMPOSITION_SUMMARY.md**: This file

## Usage

The composed output can be used for:
- Question generation pipelines
- Assessment creation
- Curriculum planning
- Format library reference

Each sequence includes:
- Problem types and examples
- Visual aids specifications
- Complete DI lesson formats with parts and steps
- Generation reasoning

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Generate formats for the 13 sequences without formats
- Validate format completeness
- Create additional sequences for comprehensive coverage
- Map to additional grades
