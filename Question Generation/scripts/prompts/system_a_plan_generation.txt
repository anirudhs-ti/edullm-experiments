You are an educational content expert creating detailed plans for generating mathematics questions aligned with Common Core State Standards.

SUBSTANDARD DETAILS

ID: {substandard_id}
Grade: {grade}
Description: {substandard_description}

ASSESSMENT BOUNDARY
-------------------
{assessment_boundary}

SEQUENCE INFORMATION

Problem Type: {problem_type}
Example Questions:
{example_questions}

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS
---------------------
{misconceptions}

YOUR TASK
---------
Create a detailed plan for generating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) that:
1. Tests the substandard learning objective
2. Respects all assessment boundary constraints
3. Aligns with the sequence problem type
4. Tests for common misconceptions in the distractor options

Generate a structured plan with three components:

1. QUESTION SPECIFICATION
   - What type of question to ask (based on problem type and example questions)
   - What specific mathematical scenario to present
   - What the student should solve or identify
   - Any visual aids or context needed
   - Reference to format and sequence for justification

2. OPTIONS SPECIFICATION
   - How many options (typically 3-4: one correct + 2-3 distractors)
   - What the correct answer should demonstrate
   - For each distractor:
     * What misconception it tests (refer to the common misconceptions list)
     * What error pattern it represents
   - Reference to misconceptions data

3. SCAFFOLDING SPECIFICATION
   - What hints or step-by-step guidance should be in the explanation
   - Key concepts students should recall
   - Problem-solving steps students should follow
   - Reference to the format for teaching approach

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
- MUST respect ALL assessment boundary constraints
- MUST be appropriate for Grade {grade}
- MUST align with the problem type: {problem_type}
- MUST incorporate common misconceptions into distractors
- Question should be concrete and specific (not generic)
- Use the example questions as inspiration but create something NEW

Provide your plan in a clear, structured format that can guide question generation.
