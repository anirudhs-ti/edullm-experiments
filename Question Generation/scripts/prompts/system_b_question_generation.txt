YOUR TASK
---------
Generate a complete, ready-to-use multiple-choice question following this exact JSON structure:

{{
  "id": "{question_id}",
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "<the actual question text>",
  "answer": "<the correct answer (must match one of the option values)>",
  "answer_explanation": "<step-by-step explanation using the scaffolding provided>",

    "language": "en"
  }},
  "additional_details": "<metadata about generation: substandard_id, format_number, sequence info>"
}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
1. QUESTION:
   - Must be clear, specific, and concrete
   - Must align with the plan specification
   - Must be appropriate for Grade {grade}
   - Use context or real-world scenarios if specified in plan
   - No generic placeholders

2. OPTIONS:
   - One correct answer that matches the "answer" field exactly
   - 2-3 distractor options based on misconceptions from the plan
   - All options should be plausible and similar in format/length
   - Options should be in logical order (numerical if applicable)

3. ANSWER_EXPLANATION:
   - Use the scaffolding provided as the foundation
   - Write in second person ("You should...", "First, you...")
   - Be clear and step-by-step
   - Help student understand WHY the answer is correct
   - Be concise but complete (3-5 sentences typically)

4. ANSWER FIELD:
   - Must be the letter (A, B, C, or D) that corresponds to the correct option
   - Example: if correct answer is in option B, then "answer": "B"

5. ADDITIONAL_DETAILS:
   - Include: substandard_id, format_number, generation timestamp
   - Brief note about question type and approach

Generate ONLY the JSON output (no additional text before or after).
