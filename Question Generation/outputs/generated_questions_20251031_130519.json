      "question": "Which equation demonstrates the zero property of multiplication?",
      "answer": "C",
      "answer_explanation": "The zero property of multiplication states that any number multiplied by zero equals zero. You should look for the equation where a number is multiplied by zero. In this case, 6 x 0 = 0 shows that when 6 is multiplied by 0, the result is 0. Therefore, this equation demonstrates the zero property of multiplication.",

        "A": "6 x 1 = 6",
        "B": "6 + 0 = 6",

      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "You should remember that 1 liter (L) equals 1000 milliliters (mL). Think about the size of a juice box. It holds a relatively small amount of liquid. Therefore, milliliters (mL) is the more appropriate unit to measure the volume of a juice box.",
