      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "To measure liquid capacity, you'll use milliliters (ml) and liters (l), remembering that 1 liter (l) equals 1,000 milliliters (ml). First, identify the item: a small teacup. Next, visualize how much liquid a small teacup holds. It holds a relatively small amount, much less than a large milk carton (which is about 1 liter) and closer to many tiny drops. Therefore, milliliters (mL) is the better unit to estimate the volume of a small teacup, as 200 mL is a reasonable amount for it.",

It forms a perfect 'L' shape. Now, look closely at the highlighted angle in the parallelogram. Imagine placing the corner of a piece of paper into that angle.

The vertical edge on the far left of the figure is 2 units tall. The vertical edge on the far right of the figure is 5 units tall. What is the total area of the figure in square units?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Area is the amount of space inside a flat shape, measured in square units. To find the area of any rectangle, you simply multiply its length by its width using the formula: Area = length \u00d7 width.\n\nFirst, you need to decompose the 'L'-shaped figure into two non-overlapping rectangles. You can do this by drawing an imaginary horizontal line from the inner corner to the left edge.\n\nThis creates two rectangles:\n1.  A bottom rectangle: Its total length is 4 units + 3 units = 7 units. Its width (height) is 5 units. So, its area is 7 \u00d7 5 = 35 square units.\n2.  A top-left rectangle: Its length is 4 units. Its width (height) is 2 units. So, its area is 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 square units.\n\nFinally, add the areas of these two smaller rectangles together to find the total area of the entire figure: 35 + 8 = 43 square units.\n\nAlternatively, you could draw an imaginary vertical line from the inner corner upwards.\n1.  A left rectangle: Its length is 4 units. Its total width (height) is 2 units + 5 units = 7 units. So, its area is 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 square units.\n2.  A top-right rectangle: Its length is 3 units. Its width (height) is 5 units. So, its area is 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 square units.\nAdding these areas: 28 + 15 = 43 square units.\n\nBoth methods give the same total area of 43 square units.",

First, identify the shaded region and clearly distinguish it from the unshaded internal space. In this problem, the outer boundary forms a 4x4 square, which would contain 16 unit squares if it were entirely shaded. However, there is an unshaded rectangular hole in the center that is 2 units wide and 1 unit tall, meaning 2 unit squares are unshaded. To find the area of the shaded region, you subtract the unshaded squares from the total squares within the outer boundary: 16 - 2 = 14. Therefore, the area of the shaded figure is 14 square units.",

You have 2 coops, and each coop has 4 nests, so you multiply 2 \u00d7 4 to get 8 nests. Next, you use this intermediate total. Since there are 8 nests in total and each nest has 3 eggs, you multiply 8 \u00d7 3 to find the total number of eggs, which is 24. Therefore, there are 24 eggs in total.",

You must then test this potential rule on *every other pair* in the table to ensure it works consistently for all of them. Once you've confirmed the single rule, you can use it to find any missing output by simply applying the rule to its corresponding input. Remember, the rule must work for *all* pairs in the table!\n\nFor the first pair (2, 8), you might consider 'Add 6' (2 + 6 = 8) or 'Multiply by 4' (2 \u00d7 4 = 8).\nNext, test 'Add 6' with the second pair (5, 20). Since 5 + 6 = 11, and not 20, 'Add 6' is not the correct rule.\nNow, test 'Multiply by 4' with the second pair (5, 20). Since 5 \u00d7 4 = 20, this rule works. You should also verify it with the third pair (7, 28): 7 \u00d7 4 = 28, which also works. So, the consistent rule is 'Multiply by 4'.\nFinally, apply this rule to the last input, 9: 9 \u00d7 4 = 36.

So, Mia collected 4 icons * 5 stickers/icon = 20 stickers, and Ben collected 6 icons * 5 stickers/icon = 30 stickers.\n2.  **First Step - Combine:** The problem says Mia and Ben 'combine' their stickers. You should use addition to combine amounts: 20 + 30 = 50 stickers.\n3.  **Second Step - Share:** Next, they 'share them equally among 5 friends.' Sharing equally means you should use division. Use the combined total from the first step and divide it by the number of friends: 50 / 5 = 10 stickers.\n4.  **Final Answer:** Each friend will receive 10 stickers.

The problem asks how many cupcakes will be in *each* box. If you were looking at a picture showing 28 cupcakes divided into 4 equal groups, you would count 7 cupcakes in each group. So, to complete the division sentence 28 \u00f7 4 = ?, the answer is 7. You can check your answer by thinking: 4 boxes with 7 cupcakes each equals 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 cupcakes total.

      "answer": "C",
      "answer_explanation": "To identify and extend a number pattern, you first need to find the rule. Look closely at the numbers in the pattern: 6, 12, 18, 24. You can see that each number is 6 more than the one before it (12 - 6 = 6, 18 - 12 = 6, 24 - 18 = 6). This means the pattern is 'add 6' or 'multiples of 6'. To find the next number, you apply this rule to the last number in the pattern. Add 6 to 24: 24 + 6 = 30. So, the next number in the pattern is 30.",

      "answer": "C",
      "answer_explanation": "To locate a proper fraction on a number line, you first need to determine the denominator. Look at the entire number line from 0 to 1 and count how many equal parts (or spaces) it is divided into. In this case, there are 6 equal parts, so the denominator is 6. Next, you need to determine the numerator. Starting from 0, count how many of those equal parts you need to make to reach point P. Point P is at the fifth tick mark, meaning you've counted 5 equal parts from 0. So, the numerator is 5. Combining these, point P represents the fraction 5/6.",

For each shape, visually inspect its sides. You will find that Shape A, Shape B, and Shape D all have two pairs of opposite sides that are equal in length. Remember that rectangles and squares are special types of parallelograms because they meet this definition. Shape C, a trapezoid, does not have both pairs of opposite sides equal in length, so it is not a parallelogram. Therefore, the correct answer is Shapes A, B, and D.",
