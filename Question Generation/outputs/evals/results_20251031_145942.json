It does not reference paragraph numbers, line numbers, section titles, specific quotes, or any other structural elements of the passage. The question simply asks students to identify parallelograms from a set of shapes shown in a diagram. Since there are no passage references to verify, the answer is 1.",

        "overall_rating": "INFERIOR",
        "overall_reason": "Although mathematically sound, the task depends on the student “imagining” four shapes that should be visually presented. For a Grade 3 geometry item, the absence of the actual diagram seriously undermines accessibility and validity. High-quality materials for this skill always supply clear images, so the content falls below the typical standard.",
        "curriculum_alignment": "PASS",
        "curriculum_alignment_reason": "Identifying parallelograms and recognizing that rectangles and squares are special parallelograms aligns with elementary geometry standards (categorizing shapes by attributes). Difficulty is appropriate.",
        "cognitive_demand": "PASS",
        "cognitive_demand_reason": "Requires students to recall the definition (DOK 1) and apply it to classify shapes (low DOK 2), which matches the intended “medium” difficulty.",
