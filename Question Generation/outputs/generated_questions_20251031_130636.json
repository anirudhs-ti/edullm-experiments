      "question": "Which equation demonstrates the zero property of multiplication?",
      "answer": "C",
      "answer_explanation": "The zero property of multiplication states that any number multiplied by zero equals zero. To identify the correct equation, you should look for a multiplication problem where one of the factors is zero. In option C, 6 x 0 = 0, which correctly shows that when you multiply 6 by zero, the result is zero. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",

      "question": "Which is the better estimate (ml or L) for the volume of a fish tank? <br> 20 <blank>",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "To determine the best unit, you should think about the size of a fish tank. Fish tanks hold a large amount of water, so milliliters (mL) would be too small of a unit. Remember that liters (L) are used for larger volumes, like jugs of water or buckets. Therefore, liters (L) is the better estimate for the volume of a fish tank.",
