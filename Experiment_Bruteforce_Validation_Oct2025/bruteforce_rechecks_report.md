## ✅ Substandards with Newly Found Matches

### CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.MD.B.4+1

**Description:** Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves and fourths of an inch.

**FAIR matches (1):**
- Sequence #3 (Data Analysis): Represent data on a line plot using a scale of less than 1
  - *This sequence has potential because it represents data on a line plot using scales less than 1 (1/2, 1/4 inch). However, the substandard focuses on generating the measurement data using rulers, not just representing it.*

### CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.A.1+4

**Description:** Solve real-world multiplication problems.

**FAIR matches (3):**
- Sequence #1 (Measurement): Multiplication/division problems with the word "each" or "every"
  - *The sequence presents real-world problems using multiplication and division. While the problems are real-world, some questions involve division, explicitly excluded by the assessment boundary. Also, problems do not restrict factors to 5 or 10.*
- Sequence #2 (Measurement): Multiplication/division problems with the word "per" or a phrase using "a"
  - *This sequence contains real-world problems and uses multiplication and division. However, some questions require division which is not allowed per the assessment boundary. Problems also do not restrict factors to 5 or 10.*
- Sequence #4 (Measurement): Multiplication/division problems with larger numerals
  - *The sequence contains real-world problems using multiplication and division. However, some questions require division which is not allowed. It also does not adhere to the factor restriction of 5 or 10.*

### CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.D.8+2

**Description:** Solve two-step word problems involving any combination of the four operations.

**FAIR matches (1):**
- Sequence #2 (Data Analysis): Solve one- and two-step problems using information presented in scaled picture and bar graphs
  - *This sequence presents one and two step problems using data presented in graphs. This covers the two-step portion and requires the use of operations to solve. The problems are not strictly word problems, however.*
