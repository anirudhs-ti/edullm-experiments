Instead, it focuses on recalling known degree measures for specific angle types (right, straight, full circle), which can be done without the tool, thus missing the core skill the standard aims to teach."
4,Measure angles on a circle.,CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.MD.C.6+3,Skill: Geometry | Problem Type: Define degree/measure angles using a protractor | Sequence: 4,Very High,0.900,"The direct instruction format directly addresses the core skill of ""measure angles"" by focusing on defining degrees and using a protractor. This is a fundamental and essential component for fulfilling the curriculum standard. The only minor misalignment is that the direct instruction's description doesn't explicitly state that the angles to be measured will *always* be presented ""on a circle,"" although it's highly probable that such examples would be included to align with the standard. The foundational skill taught is perfectly aligned, making it a very strong match."
